    Future of Arma 3: Epoch Mod
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/42869-future-of-arma-3-epoch-mod/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Creation of Arma 3: Epoch Mod started on December 15th 2013, and while community support has had its ups and downs along with the contest it did encourage us to spend more time working on the project. Epoch was a top 10 finalist in the MANW total conversion category and won the popular community vote and that I am very grateful for.
</p>

<p>
	Epoch Development Team are all volunteers and have each put in hundreds if not thousands of unpaid hours into helping create and release Epoch Mod for everyone to enjoy. Making game ready Arma assets, game modes etc. is not easy and can be very time-consuming. Special thanks go to all those that have supported us throughout our development! Epoch Mod would not exist without you! 
</p>

<p>
	Plans for next year include working with the community to further refine the MP survival framework and adding more support for singleplayer editor based missions and scenarios. The 1.0 update will bring a massive release of all remaining asset sources under APL-SA, and will be considered in the hands of the community to fork and develop as they choose. 
</p>

<p>
	Happy Holidays and New Year! Cheers to the pursuit of the next big thing!

			<em>"I think the next big thing could be opening up Arma 3 to paid user-made content. It’s great to see talented mod-makers pulling off amazing </em><em>missions, add-ons</em><em> and mods as free content, but if we manage to find some incentive for the best mod-makers to develop more content, I think we can raise the bar even higher. I want to push this effort in two distinct ways, and I consider these as a priority for next year. We are going to announce more specific details in the coming months."</em>

[NEW] Added option to toggle status icons in "Game Options" menu and via F3 hotkey. Note this will also toggle Epoch "friendly" tags because they are the same display.

[NEW] Added basic server-side authentication to hive object creation/deletion for improved security.

[UPDATED] Reverted increased waves in stormy weather to Chernarus default settings.

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">Hello,</span></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">I'm Dan also known as orangesherbet- haven't been active on these forums for some time but I've been a tester and supporter of Epoch since the early days in 2012.  More importantly, I've made lasting friendships with the development team and surrounding community of Epoch Mod. With the release of version 0.5, I wanted to organize an event that would bring all of us together to celebrate the time we've spent playing, testing, and developing (I'm not a dev) the mod!</span></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">The event itself will take place on Chernarus, where everything started!  We will have several activities for participants including a race from Kamenka debug line to NE Airfield,  a melee arena, demolition derby, "Tower of Terror" built by community developer and friend SLI, stunt contest, fishing, and base building!  </span></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">I'll be hosting the event on my stream and Discord, but I do want to make it clear that this event is about the celebration of Epoch Mod's development and not a promotion for my stream or Discord server.  I would recommend participants join my Discord server as that is where players will be welcomed to chat with each other and the admins to help us stay organized and have fun!  Feel free to leave the Discord server at the conclusion of the event if you wish.  We do have another Epoch Event in the near future and I </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">will share that information with everyone once we have a date set!</span></span>

   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hello all,
</p>

<p>
	We are pleased to announce the release of ArmA 2 DayZ Epoch 1.0.6, available for download at: <a href="http://epochmod.com/a2dayzepoch.php" rel="">http://epochmod.com/a2dayzepoch.php</a>
</p>

<p>
	This release introduces the integration of some of the most common Epoch community modifications from prior epoch release, DayZ Mod 1.8.8, and a new group system that persists in the database.  Most of the highlights can be found in the change log below, which is fairly comprehensive, but by no means exhaustive.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Please note that community addons/expansions for previous Epoch release WILL NOT work on Epoch 1.0.6, be sure to review the change log for which mods are now included. In addition, the loot table format has completely changed, you must base your loot table modifications on the new format, which can be found by evaluating the stock loot tables: <a href="https://github.com/EpochModTeam/DayZ-Epoch/tree/Release_1.0.6/SQF/dayz_code/Configs/CfgLoot" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/EpochModTeam/DayZ-Epoch/tree/Release_1.0.6/SQF/dayz_code/Configs/CfgLoot</a></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>1.0.5.1 and older Single Currency scripts are NOT compatible with 1.0.6, there is no included single currency script in this release. However, because we are so wonderful, we have chosen to integrate single currency saving to the DB, so a third-party HiveEXT is not necessary and the SQF is all that needs to be written/updated.</strong></span>

		Full gamemode and configs now in mission file.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Starting with the release of 0.3.8* everyone can make use of the work found here: <a href="https://github.com/EpochModTeam/Epoch" ipsnoembed="true" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/EpochModTeam/Epoch</a> to build your own gamemode and scripts as long as you provide credits, share sources (GitHub, etc.) and keep the same license (APL-SA). The Epoch name or logos may not be used without permission and your work should not appear to be officially endorsed by the Epoch Mod Team. 
</p>

<p>
	While the grander goal for Epoch mod still exists, the involvement of the team has been limited due to lack of time and the fact is to make anything worth while takes time. This is a small point of frustration for me as we are basically only able to do this as a hobby and while I would like to say that the Team could rally our efforts and work 40 hours a week to get to 1.0 faster that is quite simply not possible currently.
</p>

<p>
	The plan is to get the community more involved in further refining the Epoch survival gamemode so that we can then focus on the long term goal of taking Epoch Mod to 1.0 by adding additional new custom vehicles, weapons and an American themed map and much more.

<p>
	This update is more of a general maintenance update as most of my time spent on this patch has been working out issues since the Arma 1.54 update. While still not perfect nor complete I feel what has been done so far does help balance the A3 stamina systems for use with Epoch.
</p>

	Next patch in another few weeks will be adding more content, fixes and continue to refine on our features as we push towards 0.4+.
