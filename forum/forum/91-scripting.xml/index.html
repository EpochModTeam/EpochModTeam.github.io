	I'm trying to add a map marker when a player fires a weapon on the map for a few seconds for a script I'm working on. I have tried to add it to the player_fired.sqf but can not get it to work. Any help would be great!

<p style="background-color:#222222;color:#d6d6d6;font-size:14px;">
	There so many new and good mods coming out every day. The trouble is, some mods require type.xml or event.xml script to be added. Like vehicles, clothes, food, ect. Then when Dayz devs puts out an update it sends these .xml files back to default. Then I was thinking what if we had a custom type.xml and a type.xml file (same with the event too), where we can put the mod script into and have the game call from both files.
</p>

<p style="background-color:#222222;color:#d6d6d6;font-size:14px;">
	example:
</p>

<p style="background-color:#222222;color:#d6d6d6;font-size:14px;">
	All the mod's type.xml scripts will go into "custom type.xml" 
</p>

<p style="background-color:#222222;color:#d6d6d6;font-size:14px;">
	The dayz update new data will stay in the "type.xml"
</p>

<p style="background-color:#222222;color:#d6d6d6;font-size:14px;">
	So we can continue to get all the new update items and it wont effect the mods that we have on our server, and vice versa. This would be a win win for the Devs and the modding community. I was thinking of just adding custom type.xml call script, but cant find where the type.xml call script is located at in the pbo files. "<u>Any Ideas"</u><span> </span>on how to go about doing this will be very helpful and appreciated.
