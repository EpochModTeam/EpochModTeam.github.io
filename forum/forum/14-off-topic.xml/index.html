	Hi! Anybody knows why Service Host: Agent Activation Runtime and Service Host: Local Service (Network Restricted) consumes about 25-30% cpu and up to 2.5Gb or memory all the time already for several days?
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:13px;text-align:left;">
	I read that it's kind of related to the Cortana but I don't use it much. I just type something in Visual Studio and these two services keep burning my cpu.
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:13px;text-align:left;">
	I have all windows updates installed and my cpu is intel core i7-1065G7

<p>
	Hy,
</p>

<p>
	I recently started playing A2 Epoch again after quite some time and the last few days i was wondering were it all started for me..
</p>

<p>
	Then i remembered (also is in my 'about me' on this forum) that it was a server hosted by a fellow Dutchie named [AOS] Emmen.
</p>

<p>
	Well my question(s) is/are simple: <strong>What was your first ever (long term) server called that you played on? and is it still around to this day?</strong> <strong>And what made it so special?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I hope you guys can still remember your roots.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	I need advice from this Epoch forum. There are 2 issues I need to decide what to do. Do I delete them or keep them? First is the Unleashed mod files. I fixed these and it plays well. Do I just toss them?I tried to share this with the creator of the mod but he didn't seem too interested. Would be nice if it was on a launcher.  Other people would probably enjoy playing this mod, seems like a waste?
</p>

<p>
	The second issue is my own personal mod I made. I made this for my wife and I to play, I never intended to share it but I think people that like survival play would enjoy it. The problem being I used content from; Dayz mod, Epoch, Unleashed, 2017,Epidemic, and some other "things". ( and yes,even a couple things of my own ). The thought of nobody else ever playing this is kind of starting to bother me.:( It was well worth the 1000 hours it took( I'm slow), but I wish others could enjoy it too. I don't want to piss anybody off so I was just going to delete them, BUT, that is proving to be a difficult task. 
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Soooooo..... Delete or not?  Where do old files go to die? WTF should I do? Help?        Edit= problem solved

	I'm going to be running some events this week, probably starting with a night base defence in the Rung Sat Special Zone tomorrow afternoon, NYC time. If you are interested in taking part in any of these events (non-Epoch related) then just drop me a PM. Other events will include a tunnel rats mission, village clearances and riverine patrols.

<p>
	So I've tried many many times already to update my Battleye and nothing happens. I've uninstalled it and deleted the files and then gone to steam and verified the integrity of game files and still nothing! Whenever I try to join a game its starts downloading the mission files then I get kicked and in the bottom left side of my screen it says Server requiring Battleye version 1.239 up-to-date. I don't know what to do. This is not the first time that this has happened. In the past I used to to just be able to download it from the Battleye website but they no longer have the downloads. I'm trying to play Overwatch and Epoch. Those two mods are up to date. I've verified them like 10 times already. Maybe someone could share with me their battleye folders?
</p>

<p>
	Anyways please help and thanks in advanced!

<p>
	Today i was trying to play Garry's Mod. It was working for a year, no problem.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	But when i activated it today, When it's loading on FacePunch screen, it got stuck on this when loading: "Instaliazing serverside" Then crashes.
</p>

<p>
	I tried to search on internet how to fix i didn't find any.
</p>

<p>
	READ THIS IMPORTANT:
</p>

<p>
	I have uninstalled the game and redownload it, and i cached the data, and removed addons.
</p>

<p>
	That's all i gotta say.
</p>

I've worked with several indie game companies on various titles doing graphical art, those games are 3DChat and The Repopulation. <br><br>
Below are some icons I've made. I usually make them in packs and the icons displayed are just for show, there not currently in use. All of my work is custom and I can change any part of the image to your liking and create more custom icons if needed. </span><br><a href="http://s1026.photobucket.com/user/BustaPrime/media/IconSheetUpload_zps0e453a3f.png.html" rel="external nofollow"><img src="https://epochmod.com/forum/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="IconSheetUpload_zps0e453a3f.png" data-src="http://i1026.photobucket.com/albums/y321/BustaPrime/IconSheetUpload_zps0e453a3f.png"></a><br><br><span style="margin:0px;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;">Here are a few social media icons I made :p (I made the FP icon for someone else, just thought I'd add it in there)</span><br><a href="http://s1026.photobucket.com/user/BustaPrime/media/SocialIconsUpload_zps98c787b2.png.html" rel="external nofollow"><img src="https://epochmod.com/forum/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="SocialIconsUpload_zps98c787b2.png" data-src="http://i1026.photobucket.com/albums/y321/BustaPrime/SocialIconsUpload_zps98c787b2.png"></a><br><br><span style="margin:0px;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:13px;font-weight:bold;">I put my gamer tag over them for security reasons.

	It appears Cloudflare had a bit of a SSL/TLS leak going on, unfortunately this site may be one that is affected by it:

			Between 2016-09-22 - 2017-02-18 passwords, private messages, API keys, and other sensitive data were leaked by Cloudflare to random requesters. Data was cached by search engines, and may have been collected by random adversaries over the past few months.
		</p>

		<p>
			Requests to sites with the HTML rewrite features enabled triggered a pointer math bug. Once the bug was trigerred the response would include data from ANY other cloudfare proxy customer that happened to be in memory at the time. Meaning a request for a page with one of those features could include data from Uber or one of the many other customers that didn't use those features. So the potential impact is every single one of the sites using CloudFare's proxy services (including HTTP &amp; HTTPS proxy).
		</p>

		<p>
			"The greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage (that’s about 0.00003% of requests), potential of 100k-200k paged with private data leaked every day" -- source

<p>
	exilemod.com, battlemetrics.com and gametracker.com were all affected as well.
