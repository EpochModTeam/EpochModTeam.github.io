   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/48690-script-for-reducing-humanity-at-player%C2%B4s-death/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I heard that there is a script for dayz epoch where when a player dies, the humanity points are reduced by e.g. -200 or by a percentage of the humanity value of the player.<br />
	Does anyone know such a script, that would be wonderful.
</p>

<p>
	I hope someone remembers and posts it.
</p>

<p>
	I didnt find anything, but i know the ressources here in germany are not so big.

    Having an issue after installing antihack.
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/48318-having-an-issue-after-installing-antihack/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Thanks to any and all who takes a look at this and tries to help.
</p>

<p>
	My issue is that I have been following RobbieW video and readme file almost to a T and I been slowly putting a server together. (Thanks RobbieW)
</p>

<p>
	I have installed so far.
</p>

<p>
	ZSC traders, WAI missions, ESSV3 for spawn selection, This version of the server works perfectly.
</p>

<p>
	Today I installed Epoch Antihack/ Admin tools and I thought I did everything correctly, about 5 minutes into the server I am getting this error.
</p>

<p>
	ErrorMessage: Include file mpmissions\__cur_mp.Chernarus\CfgServerTraderZSC\<span style="color:#f1c40f;">CfgServerTrader</span>\CfgServerTrader.hpp not found. and before this it was
</p>

<p>
	 ErrorMessage: Include file mpmissions\__cur_mp.Chernarus\CfgLoot\<span style="color:#f1c40f;">CfgLoot</span>\CfgLoot.hpp not found.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	The issue is that there is an added file level to these lines. (I highlighted the extra non existent file) 
</p>

<p>
	The true path is MPMissions\DayZ_Epoch_11.Chernarus\CfgServerTraderZSC\cfgServerTrader.hpp  for example.  
</p>

<p>
	I solved the second error by creating the second CfgLoot file and copying all the .hpp files into it as a test. Thats when the next file issue showed up.
</p>

<p>
	Since just copping every file and making a new level will just add to my mission size and add twice the work "if I make any changes" what is causing this issue within the Antihack/ Admin tools that's adding in this extra file level? 
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Also I just noticed it's asking for CfgServerTrader.hpp with a capital C.  
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	If you have any thoughts, please let me know.
</p>

    I can't use Pgup, Pgdn in dayz to build
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/48286-i-cant-use-pgup-pgdn-in-dayz-to-build/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	I have been playing Arma 2 dayz for years now, and while I could never get the base building part to recognize my page up or page down button to raise or lower the objects, (The keys are on my numpad 9 and 3 key), I use to be able to do small up and down increments with my 8 and 2 key. till I could get the roof part or whatever I was building to snap up the rest of the way. 
</p>

<p>
	With epoch 1.07.1 now no keys raise or lower objects for me. My number keys only look around.  Has anyone run across this issue with their Pgup PgDn not working and how I can get it to be recognized even if it is a 2 key combonation.

<p>
	Hi Thanks to all developers for your work on new release.
</p>

<p>
	I would like to customize the trader location scenery but i am having no luck .
</p>

<p>
	I have tried changing what i thought to be the correct file in  dayz_code/ system /mission Napf.sqf  but this seems to be set in concrete as nothing happens.
</p>

<p>
	I thought this must be correct file because i tried not calling it and all trader scenery went away.
</p>

<p>
	Can  anyone help with how to do this

    Adding new category in trader - no name in trader menu
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/48153-adding-new-category-in-trader-no-name-in-trader-menu/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hi guys
</p>

<p>
	I am adding a new category of weapons in the trader and I have a problem.
</p>

<p>
	First I have defined the components of the category in weapons.hpp.
</p>

<p>
	class Category_80 {
</p>

<p>
	class Igla {type = "trade_weapons";buy[] = {10000,"worth"};sell[] = {6000,"worth"};};<br />
	class Stinger {type = "trade_weapons";buy[] = {10000,"worth"};sell[] = {6000,"worth"};};<br />
	class Strela {type = "trade_weapons";buy[] = {10000,"worth"};sell[] = {6000,"worth"};};<br />
	class Javelin {type = "trade_weapons";buy[] = {10000,"worth"};sell[] = {6000,"worth"};};<br />
	class M136 {type = "trade_weapons";buy[] = {5000,"worth"};sell[] = {2000,"worth"};};<br />
	class RPG18 {type = "trade_weapons";buy[] = {5000,"worth"};sell[] = {2000,"worth"};};<br />
	class RPG7V {type = "trade_weapons";buy[] = {5000,"worth"};sell[] = {2000,"worth"};};
</p>

<p>
	};
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	Then I added the category to the corresponding seller in chernarus11.sqf:
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	/***************Weapons*********/<br />
	menu_Sniper1_DZ = [<br />
	    [[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_AAAT",80],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_ATTACHMENTS",12],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_PISTOLS",13],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_SUBMACHINEGUNS",14],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_SINGLESHOT",15],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_ASSAULTRIFLES",16],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_SNIPERRIFLES",17],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_LIGHTMACHINEGUNS",18]],<br />
	    [],<br />
	    "neutral"<br />
	];
</p>

<p>
	Everything works, the weapons can be bought, but in the trader menu the category appears without a name, empty.
</p>

<p>
	I need to define the category somewhere, right? but I can't find where after a couple of hours.
</p>

<p>
	can you help me please?

    Adding Aircraft Trader 1.0.7
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/48130-adding-aircraft-trader-107/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hi guys,
</p>

<p>
	I have a 1.0.7 server which I have been able to customize without any problem. I have experience in 1.0.6, although I am not an expert.
</p>

<p>
	I have been able to install without problem all kinds of mods, wai, spawn, deploy, banking... everything... and it works perfectly. Thanks to everyone who contributes to this forum for making things easier for me with the posts of each mod.
</p>

<p>
	My problem is that I am trying to make an aircraft trader, (actually two) and I have followed these steps:
</p>

<p>
	1. dayz_server.pbo\traders\Cheranarus11.sqf
</p>

<p>
	    //Aircraft Dealer<br />
	    ["RU_Pilot",[12061,12636.3,0],20], //this is original<br />
	    ["RU_WorkWoman2",[5043.45,9731.67,0],360], //this is my add<br />
	    ["RU_WorkWoman3",[4615.33,2553.97,0],88], //this is my add
</p>

<p>
	2. dayz_code.pbo\system\mission\server_traders\chernarus11.sqf
</p>

<p>
	I have incorporated the two new sellers in the first line:
</p>

<p>
	serverTraders = ["FR_AC","GUE_Commander","GUE_Woodlander2","RU_Citizen4","Profiteer1","Rita_Ensler_EP1","Dr_Hladik_EP1","Worker2","Villager1","TK_CIV_Worker01_EP1","CIV_EuroMan01_EP1","CIV_EuroMan02_EP1","RU_WorkWoman5","Doctor","Worker1","TK_CIV_Worker02_EP1","Rocker4","RU_Citizen3","RU_WorkWoman1","Dr_Annie_Baker_EP1","Worker3","RU_Pilot","RU_WorkWoman2","RU_WorkWoman3","RU_Villager3","HouseWife1","Profiteer2","Profiteer3","Functionary1_EP1"];
</p>

<p>
	And then I have made them functional below in the same document:
</p>

<p>
	/***************Aircraft Dealer********* (original dealer)/<br />
	menu_RU_Pilot = [<br />
	    [[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_AIRPLANES",46],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_HELICOPTER",47]],<br />
	    [],<br />
	    "neutral"<br />
	];
</p>

<p>
	/***************Aircraft Dealer*********(my add)/<br />
	menu_RU_WorkWoman2 = [<br />
	    [[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_AIRPLANES",46],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_HELICOPTER",47]],<br />
	    [],<br />
	    "neutral"<br />
	];
</p>

<p>
	/***************Aircraft Dealer*********(my add)/<br />
	menu_RU_WorkWoman3 = [<br />
	    [[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_AIRPLANES",46],[localize "STR_EPOCH_TRADER_CATEGORY_HELICOPTER",47]],<br />
	    [],<br />
	    "neutral"<br />
	];
</p>

<p>
	But it does not work, the seller does not show menu. I have put a banker on each side of these vendors and it works perfectly.
</p>

<p>
	Is there something else I need to do?
</p>

<p>
	can you help me?
</p>

<p>
	thanks for reading me
</p>

<p>

    Building Wooden Fences
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/47872-building-wooden-fences/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	I am trying to build all of the new items and have found a potential bug. I want to make sure it's not just me before I report it. The item in question is the wooden fence (WoodenFence_#_DZ #=1 to 7) which goes with the wooden fence gate (WoodenGate_#_DZ #=1 to ). I can build the gate foundation from the right click menu on a log. I cannot build the fence foundation from any item. If I give myself the kit (woodfence_foundation_kit), I can build the foundation and then upgrade the fence fully.
</p>

<p>
	Looking at the following files, I cannot identify the problem; maybe someone else can. In the client release file under the path dayz_code\Configs\CfgVehicles\Buildables are FencesGates.hpp and FencesWood.hpp which correspond to these foundation kits. In the code, the fence foundation seems to be missing some items - could that be why it's not showing as a build option?
</p>

<p>
	Your help is appreceiated!

	How do I play a 1.0.6.2 after letting DayZ Launcher install 1.0.7?   I downloaded 1062 and replaced the @DayZ_Epoch directory but when I join a server I get "You where kicked off the game."

	Kodabar - where people used to post SP versions of the mod, including SP Epoch - which is why I was visiting there, as I had forgotten how to run SP Epoch.<br />
	I clicked my bookmark today, and it was gone.<br />
	Does anyone know if SP creators have re-located to a new site ?

	Hi folks
</p>

<p>
	would really appreciate some help with a strange error thats only recently started on my Arma2 Epoch 1.0.7 server
</p>

<p>
	At Random times all players on the server get kicked to the lobby, no on screen errors like battleye etc, no info just kicked straight to lobby
</p>

<p>
	In the RPT i can see this mentioned every time players are booted to lobby <span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:14px;">"From play3r UID#***: illegal gr0up m3mber LocationLogic at 10313.9,2158.59... Server may be compromised!" </span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:14px;">Im totally lost, i actually found the code block in dayz_code.pbo/system/sheduler/sched_security.sqf around line 58 it is mentioned</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:14px;">I was that desperate i even tried removing the section of code it was mentioned in but still the same issue</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:14px;">Hope someone can point me in the right direction or has some idea what is causing this</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:14px;">Many thanks in advance</span>
</p>
