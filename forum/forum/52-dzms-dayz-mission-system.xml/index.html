<p>Hi guys. I've recently started a new NAPF overpoch server having previously been running a Cherno overpoch server.</p><p></p><p>
I've done the vanilla big standard install and everything works with one exception. For some reason the mission messages don't come up on screen. Anyway ever had this?</p><p></p><p>
Missions spawn and clear on completion, just now message pips up when it spawns and no Survivors have captured...." At the end</p>

<p>This is the changed DZMS to have <strong>n Major Missions</strong> and <strong>m Minor Missions</strong>:<br><br>
1) To configure the number of Major and Minor Missions, open the file <strong>DZMSConfig.sqf</strong>.<br><br>
2) Inside it change the value of the variables:<br><br><strong>DONN_DZMS_Maj_n = 3;<br>
DONN_DZMS_Min_n = 3;</strong><br><br>
Where the first is the number of <strong>Major Missions</strong> and the second is the number of <strong>Minor Missions</strong>.<br><br>
3) When using static positions, make sure the number of positions is equal or greater than the total number of missions (Major Missions + Minor Missions).<br><br>
4) Other changes: Bots only spawn when players get at a minimum distance of 700 meters from the mission.<br><br>

<p>
	I am creating my DayZ MOD server and I have seen that the only mission system compatible with Vanilla is DZMS but AI is very dumb. Even with the skill at 1.0 she does not see me in front of her.

<p>
	DZMS is a logic and useability rewrite of the DayZChernarus Mission System.<br />
	DZMS should be considered as an "updated" DayZChernarus Mission System.<br /><br />
	Why Use DZMS instead of DayZChernarus MS?
</p>

<ul><li>
		DZMS has a simple Configuration File, no more digging through code
	</li>
	<li>
		No more junk code! (Anyone who has read add_unit_server will understand)
	</li>
	<li>
		Simple Install! DZMS Requires a single line edit. No more server_cleanup confusion!
	</li>
	<li>
		No more messy mission code! DZMS uses functions for most code.
	</li>
	<li>
		DZMS is rewrote with all maps in mind, not just Chernarus. Hence the Generic Rename.
	</li>
	<li>
		DZMS is completely server sided! No marker files needed in the Mission PBO!
	</li>
	<li>
		No more "Novy Sobor Bug"!
	</li>
</ul><p>
	Plus, many features have been added!
</p>

<ul><li>
		Option to save vehicles to the database!
	</li>
	<li>
		If Vehicle Saving is off, Users are warned when entering vehicles!
	</li>
	<li>
		Randomized Crate Loot! No more static crate loot!
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjustable Body Despawn Time!
	</li>
	<li>
		Optional: AI Ran Over have no gear!
	</li>
	<li>
		More!
	</li>
</ul><p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	The Current Version is v1.2<br /><br />

<p>Heyho :)</p>
<p>I have reright the <iframe src="https://epochmod.com/forum/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" frameborder="0" data-embedcontent="" data-embed-src="https://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/9898-release-vehicle-patrols-on-missions/&amp;do=embed"></iframe> from <a href="https://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/user/58-betterdeadthanzed/">BetterDeadThanZed</a> (Thanks for the idea), becouse it don´t work realy good at the new Patch.</p>
<p>So i think it works better as the old one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.How to install</p>
<p>2. How to upgrade</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">How to install:</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1: Open <strong>DZMSConfig.sqf</strong> and find this:</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Large Vehicles (Urals)
DZMSLargeVic = ["Ural_TK_CIV_EP1"];</pre>
<p>Underneath that, put this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Patrol Vehicles
DZMSPatrolVeh = ["HMMWV_M998A2_SOV_DES_EP1_DZE","LandRover_Special_CZ_EP1","Offroad_DSHKM_Gue_DZE"];</pre>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Step 2: Open <strong>DZMSFunctions.sqf</strong> and find this:</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
DZMSAISpawn = compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_server\DZMS\Scripts\DZMSAISpawn.sqf";</pre>
<p>Below that, add this:</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
DZMSVehiclePatrol = compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_server\DZMS\Scripts\DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf";</pre>
<p>Further down, find this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
case "large": {_vehArray = DZMSLargeVic;};</pre>
<p>Replace it with this:</p>
</div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
case "large": {_vehArray = DZMSLargeVic;};
case "patrol": {_vehArray = DZMSPatrolVeh;};</pre>
<p>Now download this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a9zax4qa0wuzlya/DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf" rel="external nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/a9zax4qa0wuzlya/DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>add the file too your <strong>DZMS/scripts</strong> folder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now you can Spawn the Patrol</p>
<p> </p>
<p>open your mission files</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and search for the code like this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//DZMSAISpawn spawns AI to the mission.
//Usage: [_coords, count, skillLevel, unitArray]
[[(_coords select 0) + 0.2803,(_coords select 1) + 25.1768, 0],5,3,"DZMSUnitsGeneral"] call DZMSAISpawn;
sleep 5;</pre>
<p>at this <span><span>previously:</span></span></p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Spawn patrol
//Position, Skill
//Usage: [_coords, PatrolRadius ,  skillLevel]
[_coords, 50, 3] call DZMSVehiclePatrol;</pre>
<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>2.How to upgrade</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>download this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a9zax4qa0wuzlya/DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf" rel="external nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/a9zax4qa0wuzlya/DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>replace the file whit the exist in your <strong>DZMS/scripts</strong> folder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>open your mission where you have add the old script.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>in the private array you have "_patrol"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>remove it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>search for the spawn code</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Spawn patrol
_patrol = ["patrol"] call DZMSGetVeh;
[_coords,   //Position to patrol
_coords, // Position to spawn
75, //Radius of patrol
10,                     //Number of waypoints to give
_patrol, //Classname of vehicle (make sure it has driver and gunner)
1 //Skill level of units 
] call DZMSVehiclePatrol;</pre>
<p>and change it whit</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">

<p>By following these directions, you can add a vehicle patrol to any mission. Please note that the code to spawn the AI vehicle comes from Wicked AI (WAI). I made small changes to make it work with DZMS because that's my skill level when it comes to modding right now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1: Download DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf and put it in your DZMS\Scripts folder: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8kg5c5v360zijz0/DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf" rel="external nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/8kg5c5v360zijz0/DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf</a></p>
<p>Step 2: Open DZMSConfig.sqf and find this:</p>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Large Vehicles (Urals)
DZMSLargeVic = ["Ural_TK_CIV_EP1"];</pre>
<p>Underneath that, put this:</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Patrol Vehicles
DZMSPatrolVeh = ["Offroad_DSHKM_Gue_DZ","Pickup_PK_GUE_DZ","Pickup_PK_INS","Pickup_PK_TK_GUE_EP1"];</pre>
<p>Feel free to add the classnames of the vehicles you wish to patrol a mission.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Step 3: Open DZMSFunctions.sqf and find this:</div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
DZMSAISpawn = compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_server\DZMS\Scripts\DZMSAISpawn.sqf";</pre>
<p>Below that, add this:</p>
</div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
DZMSVehiclePatrol = compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_server\DZMS\Scripts\DZMSVehiclePatrol.sqf";</pre>
<p>Further down, find this:</p>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
case "large": {_vehArray = DZMSLargeVic;};
};
</pre>
<p>Replace it with this:</p>
</div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
case "large": {_vehArray = DZMSLargeVic;};
case "patrol": {_vehArray = DZMSPatrolVeh;};
};
</pre>
<p>Step 4. You are now ready to add a patrol to your mission. Find the line that looks similar to this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
private ["_missName","_coords","_vehicle","_patrol"];</pre>
<p>Insert "_patrol" in the line so it looks like this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
private ["_missName","_coords","_vehicle","_patrol","_patrol"];</pre>
<p>The actual contents of that line will vary according to the mission, so just insert it at the end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To insert a patrol, use this sample code and place it below  the section that spawns the "scenery" or other non-AI items:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Spawn patrol
_patrol = ["patrol"] call DZMSGetVeh;
[_coords,   //Position to patrol
_coords, // Position to spawn
75, //Radius of patrol
10,                     //Number of waypoints to give
_patrol, //Classname of vehicle (make sure it has driver and gunner)
1 //Skill level of units 
] call DZMSVehiclePatrol;</pre>
<p>The difference between "Position to patrol" and "Position to spawn" is that if you create a different spawn point for "Position to spawn", the vehicle will start at that location and make it's way to it's patrol area. For example, if you have a bandit base located at 2684.03, 5621.7349, 0, then you could change the second line line this:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Spawn patrol
_patrol = ["patrol"] call DZMSGetVeh;
[_coords,   //Position to patrol
[2684.03, 5621.7349, 0], // Position to spawn
75, //Radius of patrol
10,                     //Number of waypoints to give
_patrol, //Classname of vehicle (make sure it has driver and gunner)
1 //Skill level of units 
] call DZMSVehiclePatrol;</pre>
<p>For most players, it probably isn't neccessary to have different starting and patrol coordinates. As a matter of fact, AI vehicles tend to get caught up on stuff so it might not even make it to the mission if you spawn it far away.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The radius of patrol is how far out the vehicle will patrol. Waypoints can be adjusted. I haven't played with that setting too much. More way points might make it more agile. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sample code from a mission:</div>
<div>
<div>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
/*

*/
private ["_missName","_coords","_vehicle","_patrol"];


//Name of the Mission
_missName = "Bandit Squad";


//DZMSFindPos loops BIS_fnc_findSafePos until it gets a valid result
_coords = call DZMSFindPos;


[nil,nil,rTitleText,"A Bandit Squad has been spotted!\nStop them from completing their patrol!", "PLAIN",10] call RE;


//DZMSAddMinMarker is a simple script that adds a marker to the location
[_coords,_missName] ExecVM DZMSAddMinMarker;


//Spawn patrol

[_coords,   //Position to patrol
_coords, // Position to spawn
75, //Radius of patrol
10,                     //Number of waypoints to give
_patrol, //Classname of vehicle (make sure it has driver and gunner)
1 //Skill level of units 
] call DZMSVehiclePatrol;


//DZMSAISpawn spawns AI to the mission.
//Usage: [_coords, count, skillLevel, unitArray]
[_coords,2,1,"DZMSUnitsMinor"] call DZMSAISpawn;
sleep 5;
[_coords,2,1,"DZMSUnitsMinor"] call DZMSAISpawn;
sleep 5;
[_coords,2,1,"DZMSUnitsMinor"] call DZMSAISpawn;
sleep 5;
[_coords,2,1,"DZMSUnitsMinor"] call DZMSAISpawn;
sleep 1;


//Wait until the player is within 30 meters and also meets the kill req
[_coords,"DZMSUnitsMinor"] call DZMSWaitMissionComp;


//Let everyone know the mission is over
[nil,nil,rTitleText,"The Bandit Squad has been Wiped Out!", "PLAIN",6] call RE;
diag_log text format["[DZMS]: Minor SM1 Bandit Squad Mission has Ended."];
deleteMarker "DZMSMinMarker";
deleteMarker "DZMSMinDot";


//Let the timer know the mission is over
DZMSMinDone = true;</pre>
<p>I will try to answer whatever questions I can. I suspect there's some extra code in there that I don't need, so for those of you with more coding experience than me, please chime in on how I can improve this.</p>

<p>I have had a player on my server ask if there is a way to make some "hero" missions instead of bandit missions. I think its a good idea but im not 100% sure how to do it or what would need changing/adding to dzms to make it work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>this is what hes posted on my forum, it might help to explain</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>
<p> </p>
<p>As we all know in the current mission system bandits are always doing the bad thing well enuf is enuf i wona see hero AI so that when the server goes quite it is still possible to gain bandit as the missions could be split.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>I.E........... One mission is for Hero's (Bandits have taken control of a weapon cash) and one for bandits (Hero's are Protecting a weapon cash)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Same mission worded different and gives different humanity so how the server could split the humanity up is.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All in bandit skins give + humanity and all in ie Marksman skins when killed gives - humanity this way these's missions could be different and bandits don't need players to achieve bandit if the server is quite</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What do you guys think and mat is this possible to do??</div>

<p>
	Is there a way to setup the direction in that the unit looks when it spawns? My DZMS units have a static spawn so they dont move. How can I setup up different direction in that each unit can look? My problem is not to get the amount of the direction it is how can I det to a specific unit. I tired that in the DZMSAISpawn.sqf

<p>Hey guys,</p><p></p><p>
Can I ask, can you use DZMS for populating an AI base like on the island in Chernarus? If so, how? Can someone link the thread please!? Thank you.</p>

<p>Before I get into this...<br><span style="font-size:24px;">THANK ZUPA </span><span style="font-size:24px;">FOR THE SCRIPT!<br><br>
DZMS Ai with Gold Coins Script / Addon<br><br><span style="font-size:14px;">Onto the tutorial!<br><br>
Open up: DZMSAISpawn.sqf which is located in:</span></span></p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
Server.pbo &gt; DZMS &gt; Scripts</pre>
<p>Once you've opened up DZMSAISpawn.sqf, search for this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Add the behaviour
_unit enableAI "TARGET";
_unit enableAI "AUTOTARGET";
_unit enableAI "MOVE";
_unit enableAI "ANIM";
_unit enableAI "FSM";
_unit setCombatMode "YELLOW";
_unit setBehaviour "COMBAT";</pre>
<p>Below the last line add this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Zupa Currency
_unit setVariable["headShots",20,true];
</pre>
<p>So it will look like this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
//Add the behaviour
_unit enableAI "TARGET";
_unit enableAI "AUTOTARGET";
_unit enableAI "MOVE";
_unit enableAI "ANIM";
_unit enableAI "FSM";
_unit setCombatMode "YELLOW";
_unit setBehaviour "COMBAT";
//Zupa Currency
_unit setVariable["headShots",20,true];
</pre>
<p>Once you have done this repack and upload! Your done!<br><br><span style="font-size:24px;">Configuration</span><br><br><span style="font-size:18px;">Value</span><br>
 </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="font-size:14px;">If you want to change the value of the money spawning on each AI,change the value:</span></span></p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
_unit setVariable["headShots",20,true];</pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
_unit setVariable["headShots",WHATEVER YOU WANT,true];
</pre>
<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Souls HIVE</span><br><br>
If you are using Souls HIVE, then instead of:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
_unit setVariable["headShots",20,true];
</pre>
<p>Change to:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
_unit setVariable["CashMoney",5000,true];</pre>
<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Variable Value<br><br><span style="font-size:14px;">If you want the AI to spawn variable values then add this:</span></span></p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
 _cash = round(random 20) * 1000; // number between 0 and 20 000
</pre>
<p>Above this:</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
_unit setVariable["headShots",20,true];
</pre>
<p>But change the line above to</p>
<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint">
_unit setVariable["headShots",_cash,true];
</pre>
<p>This will spawn money on the AI between 0 and 20,000 Gold Coins on each AI</p>

<p>
	With permission of TheVampire I'm releasing a modification of his DZMS.<br>
	All credits go to TheVampire.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Further thanks to Smitty Jagerman and NigeyS for coordinate contributions.
</p>

<p>
	DZMSHotSpots basically is a copy of DZMS, configured to run a permanent treasure hunting mission, incidently creating PvP-HotSpots as well as roadblock ambushes.<br><br>
	Download: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/90098571/DZMSHotSpots/DZMSHotSpots.rar" rel="external nofollow">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/90098571/DZMSHotSpots/DZMSHotSpots.rar</a><br><br>
	Major Missions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
		A crate is hidden on the map.
	</li>
	<li>
		Possible locations are marked but players have to search for the correct one.
	</li>
	<li>
		Markers are circles with a question mark in their center. The crate is somewhere in this circle, but not in the center.
	</li>
	<li>
		The map markers will create hotspots for your players to converge and have PvP, typically in a close quarter environment.
	</li>
	<li>
		Each mission starts with a different set of possible locations, thus making lurking at likely positions infeasible.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is always a major mission running. As soon as a mission is finished, a new set of possible locations will be marked on the map and a new crate will be placed.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Minor Missions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
		Roadblocks are created, these are not marked on the map.
	</li>
	<li>
		Some AI are manning the ambush.
	</li>
	<li>
		In the missions "RBFort","RBSandBags","RBTankTraps", a small crate is placed within a static scenery. "RBVehicleArmed" features an armed vehicle as prize.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Installation &amp; Configuration:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsStyle_spoiler">
	<div class="ipsSpoiler_header">
		<span>Spoiler</span>
	</div>

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents">
		<ul>
<li>
				You can run DZMSHotSpots alongside DZMS and have to install it the very same way. In DZMS's 1.1Final version I simply replaced all occurrences of "DZMS" by "DZMSHotSpots" and renamed the files accordingly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Center part of the configuration is the list of static locations DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsStatLocs.
			</li>
			<li>
				Currently coordinates for Chernarus, Napf and Taviana/Tavi-Origins are provided. Also included are Takistan coordinates by Smitty Jagerman and Miroslavl coordinates by NigeyS.
			</li>
			<li>
				With DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsNumber you define a number of currently used hotspots. Each time a mission starts, &lt;DZMSHotSpotsNumber&gt; locations are chosen from &lt;DZMSHotSpotsStatLocs&gt; and marked on the map.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can define the radius of the map marker circle using DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsRandR. Default is 50m.
			</li>
			<li>
				A major mission simply places a crate and 6 AI at one of these marker positions. Note that some of the AI may already be dead because they spawn within walls or on roofs.
			</li>
			<li>
				The mission will end once a player is withing 2m of the crate; the crate will despawn within 5 minutes (change with DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsSceneryDespawnTimer).
			</li>
			<li>
				DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSRoadBlocksStatLocs is used to define a different set of coordinates for minor mission roadblocks.
			</li>
			<li>
				These positions are not marked on the map, you are meant to be ambushed.
			</li>
			<li>
				A minor mission also places a crate, along with some scenery blocking the road of (in case of "RBVehicleArmed") an armed vehicle randomly chosen from the array DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsArmedVic.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can change the damage handling using DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsAIBlood
				<ul>
<li>
						DZMSHotSpotsAIBlood = 0; will continue using the Arma handler, meaning easy to kill AI
					</li>
					<li>
						using a number &gt; 0, e.g. DZMSHotSpotsAIBlood = 12000; will scale the damage dealt to the unit by 8000/DZMSHotSpotsAIBlood. That means that in the example above the unit only takes 8000/12000 = 3/4 of the damage it normally would.
					</li>
					<li>
						using a number &lt; 0 will enable using the DZAI damage handler. If you run DZAI then you should choose a value within the DZAI interval DZAI_unitBloodLevel. Note that DZAI_useHealthSystem needs to be true!
					</li>
				</ul>
</li>
		</ul>

	Miscellaneous:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsStyle_spoiler">
	<div class="ipsSpoiler_header">
		<span>Spoiler</span>
	</div>

	<div class="ipsSpoiler_contents">
		<ul>
<li>
				There are 5 predefined major missions DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsMajorArray that are different only in what type of loot is placed (HSSupply, HSMoney, HSVehAmmo, HSRareAmmo, HSLauncher).
			</li>
			<li>
				There are 4 minor mission for DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsMinorArray ("RBFort","RBSandBags","RBTankTraps","RBVehicleArmed").
			</li>
			<li>
				Be sure to adapt the loot to your server's needs. Note that I've already changed the DZMS defaults to my liking, you may want to remove the M240 nest from the supply crate as well as the complete launcher crate mission.
			</li>
			<li>
				The minor mission "RBVehicleArmed" spawns a vehicle with an active gunner who will shoot at you. Naturally for doing this he needs ammo. Any ammo he doesn't spend can be used by the player capturing the vehicle.
			</li>
			<li>
				Map marker creation is done within a modified version of Scripts/DZMSHotSpotsMarkerLoop.sqf.
			</li>
			<li>
				Map marker choice is done by a new function DZMSHotSpotsFunctions.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsGetCooSet
			</li>
			<li>
				As usual, change the interval between missions with DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsMajorMin|Max.
			</li>
			<li>
				The major mission coordinates provided are scattered around the map, mostly chosen in backyards of houses in small villages but avoiding barns because there people often build bases.  
			</li>
			<li>
				Sometimes the locations are within a building. That, however, only works well on the ground floor because crates seem to be placed at z=0. For that reason the missions only use the big USVehicleBox, smaller ones tend to vanish below the floor.
			</li>
			<li>
				To help admins with the definition of new locations, there is a variable DZMSHotSpotsConfig.sqf:DZMSHotSpotsDebug. If set to true, all possible hotspots are marked on the map, not only the &lt;DZMSHotSpotsNumber&gt; locations for the current mission.
			</li>
			<li>
				 Minor mission positions are on roads, mostly at crossroads or in sharp bends.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the mission files you could disable the placing of AI completely, thus making the crate location harder to find. The AI can be spotted from the air more easily than the crate itself.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want, you could simply tweak DZMSHotSpots to place/replace a static crate at a known position at given intervals (instead of only once per server restart)
			</li>
		</ul>

			Action shots are difficult to make - the admin tool does not hide me from the AI, so there are no pictures of an unalerted AI and the crate in one frame. Sadly I missed the one where I had the crate in view when suddenly a bot ran up behind me and shot me in the head ;-)

<p>
	I am running an Epoch 1.0.6 server and everytime a player kills an AI the AI disapears within 20 seconds. 
</p>

<p>
	It does not happen with an AI Spawner which is in my admin tool menu.
</p>

<p>
	Only when the AI has something to do with a "mission"
</p>

<p>
	This also happened for the WickedAI mod.

<p>
	Hello Community, I would like to know how to create custom missions with either WAI or DAI.
</p>

<p>
	I know there is a template for this in the missions systems but I am not sure how to use them, I can see where objects and buildings are placed and the positions they are in but how do you make buildings and objects be setup where you want them, is it done on the 3D editor?
</p>

<p>
	A video tutorial would be most helpful, if there are any people out there with experience in creating custom missions for dayzmod Epoch then I would be willing to pay you for a tutorial.
