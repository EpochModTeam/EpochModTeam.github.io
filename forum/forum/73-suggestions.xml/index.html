(Endgame motivation)</title><link>https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/43080-make-epoch-great-again-endgame-motivation/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>
	Hi.<br />
	So i've been playing epoch on and off since 2013 ( i guess? back when you sometimes would spawn as bird ...) and every time me and my pals played it (or any survival game, for that matter) we run into the same problem:<br />
	After a few weeks, once your base is "finished" and your have your favorite rifle multiple times on storage, as well as everything else you need to survive, the game becomes kinda boring. Sure there are missions, you can go player hunting/base raiding and so on, but that doesnt keep you (or at least us) playing for that much longer.<br /><br />
	So, what i toughed could counter that, with some inspiration from the great eve online:<br /><br />
	How about every town, village, logging camp, production plant and so on on the map gets some kind of "capturable" building, that would spawn a certain ammount of some ressource, per day, based on its "kind".<br />
	Like, a small town would give you enough food and water to sustain your group for that day, a industrial zone building would spawn industrial loot stuff, big cities could spawn high tier loot, and so on.<br /><br />
	These buildings could be capturabel each day at a certain hour (like, lets say, 20:00 server time) with some minor obstacles in the way to prevent someone from just walking in, so the "owners" have time to rush "home" and try to defend", but removable easy enough that you dont have to grind for days to mount an attack. (So new or small groups can jump right in to the fun)<br />
	This could be pushed even further by allowing a small number of certain deployable defence items, like sandbags, barbed wire, and so on.<br /><br />
	Well, that's basically it - it is possible?<br />
	Is it feasible?<br />
	Would you guys like it?<br />
	Please like, share and subscribe ;)<br /><br />
	regards<br />

<p><strong>I would really love to see the old known vehicle key system as in arma 2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For now the 4 days lock doesn't make really much sense for me ( currently it's not working for 4 days, only untill restart ), because there could and will be some people who think this is funny to travel around the map and lock the vehicles just for fun.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And currently how it is with the locking untill restart, yes it is like you let your base doors open, and everybody can come and take out from the base what they want.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have no chance to secure your vehicle, except you build a garage, but for choppers you dont have a chance except you are very creativ, but this is not the sense of this.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The key will give the vehicle a real value, as it is in arma 2, the people are always stressed not to lose the key, and the bandits always excited after the kill if there could be one on the corpse.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I'am sure I'am not alone with this opinion, so if you could bring back the keys, it would be fantastic.</strong></p>

	Hi!
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;">
	I'm the zeus for a small group of players(about 12) and i'm looking for an easy to use server.
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;">
	Currently i switch between hosting from my local computer and a G-portal server. Sadly with G-portal the use of mods is a very tasking manual process where i have to zip the mods, upload them via a FTP connection, create a ticket and have them unzip the mods. <a href="https://sarkariresult.onl/" rel="external nofollow"><span style="color:#000000;">https://sarkariresult.onl/</span></a> <a href="https://mobdro.onl/" rel="external nofollow"><span style="color:#000000;">Mobdro</span></a> <a href="https://pnrstatus.vip/" rel="external nofollow"><span style="color:#000000;">https://pnrstatus.vip/</span></a>
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;">
	 
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;">
	After that i still have to place the keys in the key folder. Everytime a mod updates i have to do this process again. 
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.8em 0px .25em;vertical-align:baseline;">
	Is there a server host that automates the downloading and updating of mods?
</p>

<p style="background-color:#ffffff;border:0px;color:#1a1a1b;font-size:14px;padding:.8em 0px 0px;vertical-align:baseline;">
	Regards.

<p>I'd like to just give the dev's some ideas (whether they take it or leave it, i'm not fussed). Please feel free to add to this list, consider the pros and cons of your suggestion, give a justification of its use and how it can fit the lore of the game and also think about how difficult or easy it will be to implement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consider the implications of your idea in the game and whether or not your idea will throw the balance way off, if so how can it be adjusted to maintain a healthy balance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. <strong>Craft-able trip mines</strong>, with the ability for group members to disable them within a short period of time before they detonate, ideal for defending your base while you're out exploring or logged off. These wouldn't be persistent on restart, that would be OP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. <strong>Walls with window hatches</strong> like the military towers, gives players internal vantage points and helps defend from INSIDE the base</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. <strong>Half-height walls</strong> to duck behind but short enough to see over (currently half cinder walls are still too tall for people to shoot over)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4. <strong>Metal X traps</strong> to prevent cars driving up to the walls of my base, and detonating as a second explosive, these would need to be destructible to help keep the balance right</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. <strong>Sandbags </strong>for obvious uses, would deteriorate with excessive damage/bullet penetration</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6. <strong>Internal pillars/beams </strong>to help build floors the next level up without needing to use stud walls to hold them up</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7. <b>Permanent fire pits</b> will help when the temperature effects are developed (keeps players warm), also used for cooking/smelting metals</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8. <strong>Ladders </strong>because lets face it the current stairs are not polished and cause all sorts of nightmares when building around them</p>
<p> </p>
<p>9. <strong>Elevators</strong> to help get vehicles/players to the next floor, chance to </p>
<p> </p>
<p>10. <strong>Mounted Gun turrets </strong>primarily used as Anti-Air defences, use 6.5mm clips to prevent them becoming OP </p>
<p> </p>
<p>11. <strong>Grappling hook </strong>allows players to scale up and down walls with a 25% chance to break/become unhinged to help keep the balance, requires certain weight capacity to work?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>12. <strong>Remote controls for doors </strong>allows players to open and close doors from inside their vehicles, not needing to get in and out to let themselves in, this remote might be lootable and non-persistent on restart? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>13. <strong>LARGE Remote controlled HORIZONTAL roller doors </strong>allows helicopters to be stored under these doors, make them possibly 3x3 or larger, large enough for most choppers to fit and be opened while hovering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>14. <strong>Clothes lines/Wall Hooks </strong>hang backpacks and clothes on them</p>
<p> </p>
<p>15. <strong>Lockable cabinets </strong>unlockable by base raiders with 30% chance of success. only 3 attempts, after 3rd attempt it is permanently locked until restart to balance it in favour of both attack vs defence</p>
<p> </p>
<p>16. <strong>Metal Floors/Concrete Slabs</strong> better for vehicles to drive over/be stored on without risking damage when driving up floor ramps etc</p>
<p> </p>
<p>17. <b>FirstAid boxes </b>used to heal players when another player is within 5m</p>
<p> </p>
<p>18. <b>Faucet/Sink/Tap </b>used to fill up empty jars with water</p>
<p> </p>
<p>19. <strong>Mounted rangefinders</strong> used to scout surroundings from a mounted position, could be adjustable in height to allow scouting over half walls whilst ducking, would need to be destroyable (but still quite tough)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>20. <b>Pinboard or computer </b>could be used to display a history of player activity like kills, death count, player last seen locations, current player count online, a NOTES board for group members to share information and store it (viewable to anyone who has access to it, so if you're raided enemy will gain intel into possible secondary base co-ordinates etc)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>21. <strong>Domed/Pitched roofs</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>22. <strong>Seeds </strong>allows players to plant trees/plants/vegetation patches, I dont know if its possible but much like stamina is gained over time, the plants can produce more vegetation/grow the longer they last. Will die if not regularly watered and picked?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>23. <strong>Animal pens</strong> give players the ability to harvest their own food supply with vegetation and livestock (Chicken eggs, beef/meat from cows/goats)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>24. <strong>R</strong><b>emote controlled drones/cars </b>used to scout/track movement</p>
<p> </p>
<p>25.<strong> Mounted </strong><b>Logos/Banners </b>allow players to upload/design their own logos/banners to hang on the internal or external of their base</p>
<p> </p>
<p>26. <strong>Surveillance camera log</strong> <b>per 24 hours </b>I dont know how hard this would be to do but could be checked using the computer/Pin board to tell you who recently tried to unlock your vehicle, open your door or blew down your walls. Just a text log, but would be even sweeter if you could get video replay of the activity. I expect this would be very difficult to do but would be really fun for rivalries and PVP</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please feel free to comment/add/like or dislike the things ive mentioned but remember to always justify. With any luck the devs will get hold of this and use it for future development inspiration</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I know probably shouldn't even post the obvious  but couldn't help it... As per unanimious decision the NEXT cool feature in Epoch (obviously) is Hoverboard - the personal transport of today (as of March 2035).</p>
<p>Please could we have this as soon as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is documented evidence that in a galaxy far far away as back as in year 1989 hoverboards were known to mankind as this wiki link from about 30 years ago prove:<br>
 </p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote"><div>
<p>A <b>Hoverboard</b> (or <b>hover board</b>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitating" title="Levitating" rel="external nofollow">levitating</a> board used for personal transportation in the films <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II" title="Back to the Future Part II" rel="external nofollow">Back to the Future Part II</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_III" title="Back to the Future Part III" rel="external nofollow">Back to the Future Part III</a></i>. Hoverboards resemble a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboard" title="Skateboard" rel="external nofollow">skateboard</a> without wheels. Through special effects the film-makers depicted the boards hovering above the ground. During the 1990s there were rumors, fuelled by director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zemeckis" title="Robert Zemeckis" rel="external nofollow">Robert Zemeckis</a>,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoverboard#cite_note-hoverboards-1" rel="external nofollow"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> that hoverboards were in fact real, but not marketed because they were deemed too dangerous by parents' groups. These rumors have been conclusively debunked.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoverboard#cite_note-hoverboards-1" rel="external nofollow"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Some companies hoping to leverage the commercial success of the movies have marketed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovercraft" title="Hovercraft" rel="external nofollow">hovercraft</a> vehicles as hoverboards, but these products have not been shown to replicate the experience depicted in the movies. Subsequent to the movies the hoverboard concept has been reused by many authors in various forms of media in fictional universes not directly related to <i>Back to the Future</i>. An inventor has created a prototype, magnetic hoverboard, the first of its kind outside of fiction able to provide an experience similar to those in films, though only as a levitating skateboard; currently, as the new hoverboard is a prototype researched and developed by individuals rather than significant companies, it is limited by technological and financial constraints.</p>

<p>
	When you hover with a mouse on a player and its the name is barely visible if at all, since the colours change (fade) if a player is damaged. So the more player is damaged the harder it is to see his name when getting closer and hovered with a mouse. I think it should be addressed to Epoch developers though since this problem was since the beginning. I think the colour should stay fixed and as bright enough to be able to distinguish the player's name. The damage could be indicated by the circle surrounding player's name, there is no need to change the colours. Because in Arma 3 daylight it becomes invisible.

	Wouldn't it be nice to give server admins the option to change the speed of the ATM ?
</p>

<p>
	For my taste it's much too slow and if you're not in a safezone you have nearly no chance to get/ depot your money. It needs too much time in my opinion.

one of the annoying things in epoch is a missing "Family" feature (call it what you want): Now, you can either give full access to any group member to all safes and to the whole base - but its not possible to play in a group together for one day (means: to join a party) without giving them access to everything you have.<br /><br />
Exile-mode solved this mess by adding "Families". "Family" members have full access to base and safes. But non-dependend to this you can also join any other group without having access etc., too. Means you can see your groupmebers on the map and can distinguish between groupmember and non-groupmember....</p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">44250</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2017 04:13:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ace mod and Epoch</title><link>https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/42850-ace-mod-and-epoch/</link><description><![CDATA[

<ul style="color:#24292e;font-size:16px;"><li>
		Hunger and Thirst loss rates are now affected by timeMultiplier.
	</li>
</ul><p>
	Do you guys really think this is a good idea? So by instance, a server owner wants to have nights last 20 minutes and it speeds up the time by 100. Does that mean that Hunger and Thirst also goes down 100 times as fast?<br />
	If that's the case... Well in my personal opinion I don't feel like this is a good idea.
</p>

<p>
	Love to hear what you guys think!<br />

	Up until the last upgrade I have always been able to look to the right or the left while in a vehicle using my mouse. Now I have to use the Alt key which doesn't make any sense at all. Also the menu that use to show in the upper left corner to change your weapon doesn't show anymore either. And the 1, 2, 3 buttons in either Arma3 or Epoch doesn't work either. I have to use the semi-colon to change the weapon. I enjoy the game and I would like the options that I have had since I first started playing this game back again. I have over 2800 hrs of playing Arma3.  Thank you.

	G'day All,
</p>

<p>
	Would it be probable in future updates to have an option to set what type and quantity of Antagonists spawned via a drone when triggered by the player.

<p>
	Not the best example (as status bar is blocking it) but it is obviously pain in the ass to read player names even when they are standing still. The letters disappear very quickly if you move your mouse slightly and it is always at the lowest bottom, not center or top. Also blue colour doesn't make it easier either. Maybe some other shade, now it is just too transparent.

<p>
	Well, let's research and figure out the roots of evil.
</p>

<p>
	@epochhive\addons\epoch_server\compile\epoch_vehicle\EPOCH_server_save_vehicle.sqf
</p>

<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted">
<span class="pln">        _VAL = [typeOf _vehicle,[(getposATL _vehicle call EPOCH_precisionPos),vectordir _vehicle,vectorup _vehicle],damage _vehicle,_hitpoints,fuel _vehicle,_inventory,magazinesAmmo _vehicle,_colorSlot];
        ["Vehicle", _vehHiveKey, EPOCH_expiresVehicle, _VAL] call EPOCH_fnc_server_hiveSETEX;</span></pre>

<p>
	Okay. WTF is EPOCH_precisionPos?
</p>

<p>
	@epochhive\addons\epoch_server\compile\epoch_server\EPOCH_precisionPos.sqf
</p>

<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted">
<span class="pln">private["_low"];
_low = _this apply {_x - (_x % 1)};
[_low, _this vectorDiff _low]</span></pre>

<p>
	Looks weird, but <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span>there is nothing</span> rly <span>suspicious</span></span> if you do some math.
</p>

<p>
	Okay. Let's research MOAR!
</p>

<p>
	@epochhive\addons\epoch_server\compile\epoch_vehicle\EPOCH_load_vehicles.sqf
</p>

<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted">
<span class="pln">                        // set final direction and postion of vehicle
                        _vehicle setVectorDirAndUp _worldspace;
                        _vehicle setposATL _location;</span></pre>

<p>
	where _location is just a record taken from DB (previously saved)
</p>

<p>
	So, what the duck is wrong with this code? Why we are still loosing our vehicles after server restart?
</p>

<p>
	The answer is <strong>setPosATL</strong>. This function always adds random offset to coords of your object. <strong>setPosASL</strong> do it in the same way (Hello BIS! Burn in hell ya all!)
</p>

<p>
	<span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span>As a result</span></span> all saved vehicles and buildings will be spawned not in exactly saved position.
</p>

<p>
	So, how to solve this problem?
</p>

<p>
	The answer is<strong> getPosWorld/setPosWorld.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/setPosWorld" rel="external nofollow">https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/setPosWorld</a>
</p>

<p>
	If you change any <span>"</span>ATL/ASL" functions to "World", you will get control of precisious positioning of any objects on the map.
</p>

<p>
	Here is simple sp-mission to test  <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769644621" rel="external nofollow">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769644621</a>

	P.S. Sorry for my bad googletranslanguage )

	Possible to make a server side option that can bypass having to always select your gender at spawn?  Like have it attached to your profile or something on those lines. I personally dislike the whole spawn room thing and prefer just loading right into a map, but if thats not possible then at least a way to skip that annoying step of gender selection would be a very welcome addition.

<p>
	Is there anyway to add some functionality to change the overall appearance of the group hexagon and waypoint marker? Like change colors, make them bolder etc etc...
</p>

<p>
	In talking with other players including those in my group, the vast majority (aside from those using 40 inch tv's for a monitor lol) have a horrible time trying to always locate the group hexagon or waypoint. Was hoping there might be a way to change them up to make them more visible.
</p>

<p>
	One idea I had for waypoints was when you get into a vehicle it always shows the small radar in the top center and if you place a waypoint marker it shows an arrow or small square orange box pointing to it so you always know which direction to head for that marker. Why not an option to have that same kind of small radar while on foot and have it so you can move it to where you prefer on the screen or disable it of you prefer not to see it and instead fall back to the above options to make them more visable?
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Just my 2 cents :)

<p>With the new patch 0350 you have changed the way we use the interaction menu due to the new gui.  We can no longer use the space bar to action the selection on our interaction menu.  For example, I used to scroll to lock a door then hit space, or scroll to my pistol and hit space to switch.  With the new gui space is used to lock/unlock or do building.</p><p>Please can I have my space bar back.</p><p> </p><p>Fiddy</p>
