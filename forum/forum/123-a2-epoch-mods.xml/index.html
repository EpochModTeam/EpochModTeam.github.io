<p>
	Hello to all survivors!
</p>

<p>
	I found a ready-made assembly here on the forum Epoch-OriginsMod-Server-Package (Epoch 1.0.7 &amp; Origins Mod 1.8.3). And the assembly works, well, almost. Equipment is not taken away during the sale, as a result, you can sell one car indefinitely. The fact is that this assembly is for the version of the mod Epoch 1.0.7.  And I need to run the server on the version Epoch 1.0.7.1. 
</p>

<p>
	I try to run a clean server and I get some white walls in the game almost on the entire map. They seem to divide the map into huge rooms. However, they disappear when viewed in an arc direction. Please tell me what am I doing wrong? Sorry for my english, I'm through a translator.
</p>

<p>
	Hello everyone,
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Here is the public release of my Antihack / Admin tools. Both myself and Movinggun put a lot of work into this, so I hope you all can benefit. The culmination of my time spent on this game went into this, and I hope you all enjoy it just as much as I did.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately due to time, I will not be able to actively add to this project, but I will always be around to approve pull requests. This project can easily live on through the community, and I hope you all the enjoy the complexity of everything involved with it.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	The repository that contains install instructions can be found here:

	<a href="https://github.com/BigEgg17/Epoch-Antihack-Admin-Tools" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/BigEgg17/Epoch-Antihack-Admin-Tools</a>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I will add source code for the DLL as soon as it is received from Movinggun, along with the source for the executable file.
</p>

<p>
	I will also create an official release on the Github as soon as everything is successfully converted for compatibility with 1.0.7.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Best wishes to the community, I look forward to applying all changes desired, and to answering any questions members may have.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	It's been a blast and I will never forget some of the memories and friends made on this game.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Edit: Should be also working for 1062, as ive seen some servers running this
</p>

<p>
	Hello guys i've decided to release my "Debug Monitor". It's not much like a monitor but its looking quiet nice.
</p>

<p>
	This was originally for my Napf and Chernarus server and i thought why not share it, since the players seemed to like it.
</p>

<p>
	So how does it look like? <img alt="45Cwdaz.png" class="ipsImage" src="https://epochmod.com/forum/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/45Cwdaz.png"></p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:24px;"><strong>Wicked AI 2.2.6</strong></span>
</p>

<p>
	This release is for DayZ Epoch/Overpoch 1.0.6.2.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/f3cuk/WICKED-AI" rel="external nofollow">&lt;&lt;&lt;Download Here&gt;&gt;&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
	Due to reports of poor performance on high population servers. I have rewritten this mod so it runs more efficiently.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the work is code optimization and bug fixes, but I did add some new features.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>Review of changes</strong></u>
</p>

<ul><li>
		Each mission only spawns one thread with one loop unless it has a para-drop, then it spawns two.
	</li>
	<li>
		The patrol missions also spawn two threads for now.
	</li>
	<li>
		The mission files no longer suspend, waiting for the mission to complete to spawn the crate loot and remove the mission data.
	</li>
	<li>
		The minefield feature no longer spawns an individual thread for each mine. It uses a player check radius.
	</li>
	<li>
		Players in vehicles receive a bold red warning when they are 200 meters from the edge of a mine field.
	</li>
	<li>
		Optional mission vehicle entry messages.
	</li>
	<li>
		Improved mission clean up. All mission objects and data are deleted including unclaimed vehicles and AI unit groups.
	</li>
	<li>
		The AI monitor loop has been replaced by a modified version of the server scheduled function sched_corpses.
	</li>
	<li>
		AI vehicles no longer spawn their own vehicle monitoring threads. It is all handled in the mission thread in a queue.
	</li>
	<li>
		The invisible static gun glitch has been fixed.
	</li>
	<li>
		The static spawns have a dedicated monitoring loop much like the mission system. One loop manages all vehicles and deletes AI unit groups.
	</li>
	<li>
		Where possible, I moved commonly used code blocks to compiled functions.
	</li>
	<li>
		I made a few new missions - hero outpost, bandit outpost, and farmer.
	</li>
	<li>
		Captured MV-22, medical camp, and weapon cache missions have been reworked for improved aesthetics and/or functionality.
	</li>
	<li>
		Rewritten auto claim feature that is fully integrated.
	</li>
	<li>
		Boat patrols - examples in the static mission files.
	</li>
	<li>
		Redundant and\or unnecessary code has been removed from some of the files.
	</li>
	<li>
		I cleaned up and standardized the formatting in the mission files and elsewhere.
	</li>
	<li>
		Helicopters for AI drops and patrols start at a random distance of 3k to 4k away from the mission instead of way down by debug island.
	</li>
	<li>
		Added a new check for mission locations. As they are used, positions get added to an array and checked in find_position.sqf, so missions will not spawn in the same spot twice.
	</li>
	<li>
		Optional indestructible mission vehicles.
	</li>
	<li>
		The AI and mission clean up times and spawn schedule in config.sqf have been converted to minutes for easier reading.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fixed an issue with the spawn time delays in the mission init file.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjusted the distance the vehicles spawn from the crate so there is no trouble with accessing gear when near a locked vehicle.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can disable static gun placements, vehicle patrols, and paratrooper drops on missions with variables in config.sqf
	</li>
	<li>
		AI numbers have been standardized on all missions. You can adjust the numbers. Easy = 5-10, Medium = 10-15, Hard = 15-20, Extreme = 20-25.
	</li>
	<li>
		I removed the cache units feature because it spawns a thread with a monitoring loop for each unit group and it only works on ground troops.
	</li>
	<li>
		I moved the Dynamic Text mission announcements up the screen and made the text a little smaller so it is not so overwhelming.
	</li>
	<li>
		Added a second dynamic text option for the minefield warnings.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fixed the "auto-repair" glitch on mission vehicles. This also fixes the inability to repair mission vehicles due to the hitpoint variables not being set.
	</li>
</ul><p>
	<u><strong>Notes</strong></u>
</p>

<ul><li>
		The AK_74 and RPK_74 variants have been disabled in config.sqf until the 1.0.6.3 patch because the 45rnd 5.45mm magazine was removed in the A2 OA 1.64 corepatch and they post errors to the logs.
	</li>
	<li>
		The format of the missions has changed, so if you have your own custom missions they will have to be adjusted.
	</li>
	<li>
		I have updated the mission example file and created a new mission example file for a single spawn point mission. They are heavy on comments to help server owners create their own missions.
	</li>
	<li>
		I have left extensive comments throughout the updated files if you want to understand more about how the updated code and functions work.
	</li>
</ul><p>
	Since this is a major coding overhaul, this release will not be merged into the main github repository until all potential bugs, errors, and incompatibilities have been corrected. Please report errors, discrepancies, and general weirdness in this topic.
</p>

<p>
	Also, most of the files have been altered, so please use this version as a base and merge your custom files into it, paying attention to the changes.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Optional Mission Vehicle Entry Messages</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	If you turn this option on players will get a message that says either "You have claimed this vehicle! It is now saved to the database." or "WARNING: This vehicle will be deleted at restart!" depending on if you have vehicle hive saving turned on or not. This feature can be toggled with this variable:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L101" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L101</a>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Indestructible Mission Vehicles</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	This option will disable the damage handlers on mission vehicles until a player enters them. It can be toggled on and off with this variable:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L99" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L99</a>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Avoid Same Spot</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	This option will prevent a mission spawning in the same spot twice by adding the position to an array. The find position function will check that a new position will not be selected that is within 200 meters of one that was previously used.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L80" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L80</a>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Enable/Disable Static Gun Placements, Vehicle Patrols, and Paradrops</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	I added this feature for scalability and because someone asked for it. These are the variables to set true or false.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L115-L117" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L115-L117</a>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Auto-Claim</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	The original author of the auto-claim feature is no longer a part of this community. I wrote my own version of it which is fully integrated. I never really used this mod myself in the past, so please let me know if I need to add features that were there previously.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L222-L229" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L222-L229</a>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Boat Patrols</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	There is really no difference between a boat patrol and a land vehicle patrol other than the classname of the vehicle the fact that they spawn offshore. I have placed examples in the static mission files and I left my Skalisty Island test boat patrols commented in the chernarus.sqf file. To activate them, enable the static_per_world feature in config.sqf and remove the comments from this section:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/static/Chernarus.sqf#L114-L147" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/static/Chernarus.sqf#L114-L147</a>
</p>

<p>
	When creating boat patrols you should make sure that the distance you place them offshore is at least the distance of the radius used for waypoints, otherwise the waypoints will be on land and the AI might not handle the boat correctly.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/static/Chernarus.sqf#L140" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/static/Chernarus.sqf#L140</a>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Mission Cleanup</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	All mission data and mission objects will be removed from the map after mission completion or mission timeout, including the ai unit groups and unclaimed mission vehicles. You can remove the crates from cleanup if  you want them to remain on the map for looting by toggling this variable to false:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L94" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/WICKED-AI/blob/master/WAI/config.sqf#L94</a>
</p>

<p>
	If a player is within 75 meters of the crate, it will not be deleted as it is assumed that it is still being looted.
</p>

<p>
	To "claim" a mission vehicle, a player simply has to get into it and it will not be deleted.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Invisible Static Gun Glitch</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Credit to salival for discovering that this was a JIP issue and the fix is to have the AI get out and back into the static gun at regular intervals. During testing, I could not even see this happening unless I added a sleep, so players shouldn't notice.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Static Spawn Manager</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Instead of having each static spawned group and vehicle spawn its own monitoring thread, the data is added to a multi-dimensional array and monitored in one loop. The monitor is spawned from the static init.sqf file and will shut down when all null AI groups have been removed from the array.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	The Overwatch configs have been moved to its own file in the configs folder. The file is not loaded unless the Overwatch mod is detected.
</p>

<p>
	According to KillZone Kid and other Arma super nerds, when selecting random things from arrays, it is faster to use a statement like this: selection = array select (floor (random (count array))); instead of calling BIS_fnc_selectRandom. I replaced several instances in files where it is called repeatedly like dynamic crate and group spawning. This might save a millisecond or two <span>:).</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>That is all of the updates I can think of right now. If I can remember more, I will add them.</span>

</p>

<p>
	Special thanks to Salival who updated the addon. I just updated the install instructions, cleaned up the repository a bit<br />
	and fixed broken links and paths.
</p>

<p>
	Download and installation is provided on salivals github.<br /><a href="https://github.com/oiad/DZAI" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/oiad/DZAI</a>

<p>
	Hey guys releasing another script I made(or rather a compilation of scripts). I created this to make my admins lifes(lives?) easier in the game, hope someone finds it useful! :)
</p>

<p>
	I created this for overpoch so some functions may not work on other mods(e.g. delete all nissans)
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:20px;">Tools Included:</span>
</p>

<p>
	Quarantine Target(teleports the selected player to debug island, could come in handy for misbehaving players)
</p>

<p>
	Explode Target(Explodes the selected player)
</p>

<p>
	Edit Bank(Opens a dialog that allows you to edit the selected players bank if you use zsc. If you dont use zsc everything else should still work)
</p>

<p>
	Temporarily Delete all the Bikes on the map
</p>

<p>
	Temporarily Delete all the nissan 350z's on the map
</p>

<p>
	OTF Script Writer(thanks DuMa for the help with this)
</p>

<p>
	Explosive Bullets(makes big bang bang)
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:20px;">How to install:</span>
</p>

<p>
	In your a2_infiSTAR folder create a folder called "custom".
</p>

<p>
	In this folder create a file called "category.sqf" and another file called "functions.sqf"(without the quotation marks, obviously)
</p>

<p>
	In category.sqf put this code:
</p>

<div class="ipsSpoiler" data-ipsspoiler="">

<p>
	This is a reworked and updated version of JAEM originally from <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://epochmod.com/forum/profile/2156-otternas3/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="2156" href="https://epochmod.com/forum/profile/2156-otternas3/" rel="">@OtterNas3</a> This version is compatible with DayZ Epoch 1.0.7.
</p>

<p>
	A complete set of install instructions is provided on my github repository <a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/Just-Another-Evac-Chopper-Mod" rel="external nofollow">Download Here</a>
</p>

<p>
	Let me know if you have trouble understanding them or if I made a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>New Features</strong></u>
</p>

<ul><li>
		ZSC support -  you can choose between Epoch currency or ZSC to pay for your evac chopper.
	</li>
	<li>
		Deploy Anything - you can use Mudzereli's right-click actions to call the evac chopper instead of using the built in self-action loop.
	</li>
	<li>
		Plot pole and plot friends restriction - to prevent players from placing evac helipads in obnoxious places, they have to build them on their own plots or their friends plots.
	</li>
</ul><p>
	I have placed all of the config variables in one place in varables.sqf. The variables all have explanatory comments. Adjust them to your preferred settings:
</p>

<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted">
<span class="pln">// Evac Chopper Config Variables
evac_chopperPrice = 1; // This is the price players pay in full briefcases to set up an evac chopper (between 1-12 briefcases). Players must have the briefcases in their inventory.
evac_chopperUseZSC = false; // If you have ZSC installed you can set this to true and have players pay the amount below to set up an evac chopper.
evac_chopperPriceZSC = 100000; // Price for evac chopper if you have ZSC Installed and evac_chopperUseZSC set to true.
evac_chopperMinDistance = 500; // Minimum distance for player to call evac chopper. Do not set this lower than 500.
evac_chopperZoneMarker = 0; // Evac zone marker type (0 = Landingpad | 1 = Smoke).
evac_chopperNeedRadio = 0; // 1 - Require player to have a radio in gear to call evac chopper | 0 - Doesn't require radio to call evac chopper.
evac_chopperUseClickActions = false; // If you have Mudzereli's Deploy Anything installed and are going to use click actions to call the evac chopper, set this to true (disables call chopper self-action loop).</span></pre>

<p>
	<u><strong>Functionality Instructions</strong></u>
</p>

<ol><li>
		if you have any other mods which save classname "HeliHRescue" to the database, be aware that this particular classname is used along with ownerID to make this mod work.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you already have an instance of HeliHRescue saved to the database with your playerUID, then you will get a message stating that you cannot create another when trying to set an evac chopper.
	</li>
	<li>
		To create an evac chopper you need a keyed helicopter, a plot pole, and the money to make the purchase.
	</li>
	<li>
		You have to have the key in your inventory to set and clear the evac chopper field.
	</li>
	<li>
		Walk up to the helicopter and you will get blue self actions for setting and clearing the evac chopper field.
	</li>
	<li>
		You do not have to have the key on you to call the evac chopper.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is a flight status monitor that appears in the same place as the debug monitor, so you will want to have the debug toggled off to view it.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you use Mudzereli's right click actions, make sure to set variable evac_chopperUseClickActions to true to disable the built in self action loop.
	</li>
	<li>
		If your helicopter is destroyed simply place a new one on the rescue helipad. The call evac chopper function finds the nearest heli (within 10 meters) of your rescue helipad.
	</li>
	<li>
		It does not return your money when you disable the evac chopper.
	</li>
</ol><p>
	<u><strong>Known Issues</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	There is only one known issue at this time. If the player is killed while the evac chopper is in route, the helicopter will not return to base. The pilot lands at the evac zone, gets out of the heli and just stands there. The helicopter remains locked. The way the code is written, it looks like it should work, but everything I have tried thus hasn't fixed it. I might try using some diagnostic logs to try to find where the breakdown is later. As long as you don't die before it gets there, it's smooth sailing.
</p>

<p>
	Enjoy!

	<strong>craftAnything for DayZ Epoch 1.0.7.1+</strong><br />
	A script I originally wrote for TLF servers, but with their permission I am releasing to the public to celebrate getting the A2 Community Dev role in the Epoch Discord. This script allows you to add a ton of craftable items to your server. It is super modular, and takes up very little space. It is also very easy to configure. You can add as many configs as you want. TLF has come up with about 40 custom crafting configs, I have included their turret configs in the example configVariables.sqf file.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Installation &amp; Setup</strong><br />
	Download the code as a zip file here <a href="https://github.com/ZzBombardierzZ/DayZ-Epoch-CraftAnything/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/ZzBombardierzZ/DayZ-Epoch-CraftAnything/archive/refs/heads/main.zip</a><br />
	Copy the craftAnything.sqf file into your mission folder, inside of a "scripts" folder. Example: "ServerRoot\mpmissions\DayZ_Epoch_11.Chernarus\scripts\craftAnything.sqf"<br />
	In your compiles.sqf file, copy the bomb_combineArrayOfDuplicates section in the provided compiles.sqf file and paste it at the in your compiles.sqf file somewhere under if (!isDedicated) then { as shown in the file.<br />
	In configVariables.sqf, find the DZE_CLICK_ACTIONS array and add the desired configs to it. See the example configVariables.sqf file for more info.<br />
	Go into the newly created craftAnything.sqf file and edit the "CONFIG SECTION" to your liking. Read the comments in the file for more info.
</p>

<p>
	<br /><strong>Battleye Filters</strong><br />
	If you are using Battleye on your server, you will need to update your scripts.txt file to allow the script to run. I am not going to provide a list of filters unfortunately. It is fairly easy to do yourself. You can look at <a href="https://opendayz.net/threads/a-guide-to-battleye-filters.21066/" rel="external nofollow">OpenDayz Guide to BattlEye</a> to learn more about BattlEye filters and use <a href="https://github.com/eraser1/BE_AEG" rel="external nofollow">eraser1's BE_AEG</a> to generate scripts.txt filters automatically.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Credits</strong><br />
	As mentioned before, I originally wrote this script for TLF servers. I would like to thank them for allowing me to release this to the public. I would also like to thank the Epoch Discord community for their help and support and for giving me the opportunity to become a Community Developer.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>License</strong><br />
	There is none. But please give credit where credit is due. If you do use this script, please let me know. I would love to see what you do with it.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Contact</strong><br />
	If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact me on Discord at <span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">ZzBombardierzZ#5945</span> or in the Epoch Discord server.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Changelog</strong><br />
	v1.0.0 - 2023-01-22 - Initial release<br />
	v1.0.1 - 2023-04-12 - Added bomb_combineArrayOfDuplicates function to compiles.sqf file. Thanks to Gnominger in discord for pointing out this issue.

	<span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:22px;">Good morning, survivors. <br /><br />
	Is there anyone out there still hosting A2 Epoch? I'm addicted and can't seem to walk away. I'm looking to add gem crafting to my server but I can't seem to find a working script. I've installed the ones below but they either have problems or I'm doing something wrong. Any help would be appreciated! I've installed alchemy crafting in the past but there have been a lot of updates since. Is there anyone out there that would be willing to share a working script with a friend in need <img alt=":rolleyes:" data-emoticon="" src="https://epochmod.com/forum/uploads/emoticons/rolleyes.gif" title=":rolleyes:" /><br /><br />

<p>
	Hey guys, this is the release of my O9 Gambling Script. If you like to add this feature to your server you can do it now with that offical release.
</p>

<p>
	Go to github download and install the files:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://github.com/AirwavesMan/O9-Gambling-Script" rel="external nofollow">O9 Gambling Script</a>
</p>

<p>
	If you have cards you get a free gambling try.
</p>

<p>
	You can gamble for 1000, 2000 and 3000 Coins and get the price 1x, 2x and 3x. The script is not optimized but it works out of the box and can be used with overpoch.
</p>

<p>
	Hi,
</p>

<p>
	Has anyone ever gotten the elevator script to run?
</p>

<p>
	I can build the elevator only it is not included in the system. Does that mean I can't select the elevator to add a stop?

<p>
	I didn't find any script for teleportation that I could implement for my players on my server,  so I made this script.   I made a short demonstration : 
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="113" title="Teleporter Prototype V2" width="200" data-embed-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lWdex3iY9VY?feature=oembed"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Install: 
</p>

<p>
	<span style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.05);color:#0f0f0f;font-size:14px;"><a href="https://github.com/Marcusmoldev/Arma2_Dayz_Teleporter" rel="external nofollow">https://github.com/Marcusmoldev/Arma2_Dayz_Teleporter</a></span>
</p>

<p>
	In its current state it is limited to two portals as I don't want my players to have portals everywhere, but this functionality is absolutely something one can implement in the future .. I don't plan on doing that for the moment though ..
</p>

<p>
	Also if you do end up installing the script, let me know if there are any typos in the readme and I'll try to correct them.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks and enjoy
</p>

<p>
	Old thread is cluttered with my asking a lot of questions so here Ill repost the new script
</p>

<p>
	This script is a redo of the epoch salvage system which, in my opinion, was good for tires and glass, nothing more. This changes that. Now you can completely dissassmble a vehicle into the components you need to fix any other vehicle (plus many other components as well!) and will then remove them from the database. This is not magic, you will have to put in the work, take the risk and pray you dont get eaten along the way!
</p>

<p>
	What does this do exactly? Glad you asked! You can now reduce a vehicle into parts! All of them (and I mean ALL). Never again will you run across your favorite vehicle and not be able to drive off because you forgot your engine parts at home. That skoda 100m back can be your life saver (and I dont mean by means of driving off), just get to your nearest chop shop, get your toolbox and crowbar handy, and get rid of that ugly POS! You will be left with one less eye sore and a score of parts to drive your baby home! All parts are acquirable through scrapping. This means: Tires, Glass, FuelTank, Engine, Scrap Metal plus some cool new stuff: 1 &amp; 2 inch pipes, metal sheets, scrap electronics, floppy wire (and many more to be added!). Maybe you are down on your luck and need a weapon, well that DshKM could be yours after a scrapping(still to be implemented)!
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Things to do:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong><s>Fix breaking the dissambly chain leading to broken action(thanks </s><a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://epochmod.com/forum/profile/16876-runewulv/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="16876" href="https://epochmod.com/forum/profile/16876-runewulv/" rel="D">@Runewulv</a>)</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<s><strong>Add weapon salvage with chance</strong></s> Needs configuring of conversion options
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Possibly change from loot in crate to loot on ground</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>add some trolling possibilities</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Add a config file for the many options to come!</b>
</p>

<p>
	Install:
</p>

<p>
	go to my github and download the repository
</p>

<p>
	<strong style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#555555;font-size:14px;">my github link <a href="https://github.com/Arstan13/EpochScrapper" rel="external nofollow" style="background-color:transparent;color:#313131;">https://github.com/Arstan13/EpochScrapper</a></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Now it is assumed you have already installed one of the many better written, better made, more useful scripts out there so we are going to skip the custom compiles/variables/self-actions
</p>

<p>
	add my snippets for fn_selfActions and Variables to your (more than likely) custom ones
</p>

<p>
	drag and drop the scrapper folder into your scripts folder in your mission file!
</p>

<p>
	and thats it! Too easy right!? If you still have trouble at this point, let me know. Got an idea? LET ME KNOW!
</p>

<p>
	Im definitely in the need of information on what vehicles have what weapons on them, I need this info to make it so you <em>could</em> scrap it! Your helping me only leads to more awesome function for you so please consider it!

<p>
	I have a pull request in with <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://epochmod.com/forum/profile/12333-noxsicarius/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="12333" href="https://epochmod.com/forum/profile/12333-noxsicarius/" rel="">@NoxSicarius</a>. I am waiting for him to merge my updates.
</p>

<p>
	This version of Epoch Admin Tools is still considered "test branch" until Nox says otherwise. I spent a great deal of time fixing and updating files. Everything works with a few minor exceptions. Those are listed below.
</p>

<p>
	Complete install instructions and changlog provided in my github repo. <strong><a href="https://github.com/worldwidesorrow/Epoch-Admin-Tools/tree/TestBranch" rel="external nofollow">Download Here.</a></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Once Noxsicarius merges my updates, I will change the github link.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>New Features</strong></u>
</p>

<ul><li>
		Admin tools can be activated with hotkeys rather than with the traditional self-action loop. Hotkey activation is turned on by default.
	</li>
	<li>
		Server-side AI spawner. You can choose hero/bandit ai, select the spot on the map where they spawn, and receive humanity gain/loss and bandit/human kills.
	</li>
	<li>
		Server-side crate spawning to avoid Battleye kicks from the new BEserver.cfg settings.
	</li>
	<li>
		Nox's debug monitor integrated - toggled with Ins key.
	</li>
	<li>
		Dynamic text messages added as an option to safezone script.
	</li>
	<li>
		Toggle grass on/off added as an option to player action menu
	</li>
	<li>
		Set view distance added as an option to player action menu. Players can adjust view distance from 1000-5000 meters in 500 meter increments.
	</li>
	<li>
		Base manager fixed and updated with new dialogs. Still does not work with vectors though. That is a tough update.
	</li>
	<li>
		The graphical vehicle spawn menu has been upgraded so you can choose between all vehicles and Epoch only vehicles. Mods can only spawn Epoch vehicles. The old vehicle system has been removed.
	</li>
</ul><p>
	<u><strong>Keybinds</strong></u><br />
	 
</p>

<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted">
<span class="pln">F2		- Activate admin tools (if enabled by setting variable EAT_AdminMenuHotkey to true)
F4		- Admin mode/mod mode options - when toggled on
F6		- Cancel spectate
4		- Admin teleport
5		- Teleport player to admin
6		- Teleport to player
7		- Enhanced ESP options - when toggled on
U		- Unlock vehicle/safe/lockbox/door
L		- Lock vehicle/safe/lockbox/door
J		- Display object information in systemchat

Ins		- Toggle Debug
Tab		- Activate action menu (if enabled by setting variable EAT_ActionMenuHotkey to true)
Shift+w	- Fastwalk or vehicle boost - when enabled
q,w,a,s,d, and space bar are used if flying is toggled on</span></pre>

<p>
	<strong><u>Additional Information and Issues</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	I have updated pretty much all of the files in this mod. As far as I can tell they run completely error free. There are a couple of issues though.
</p>

<p>
	The Base Manager does not work with vectors. I tried to get it to work, but the fix eluded me. It will take someone with more knowledge of the vector system to fix it.
</p>

<p>
	The GUI based building spawner is a bit wonky. Sometimes the buildings will spawn too far away from the player and the 20 meter build range deletes the building. This system should probably have its own build function. The building selection also needs improvement.
</p>

<p>
	In order to use the GUI based building spawner you will have to disable a couple of lines in createvehicle.txt. I did not add all of the buildings as exceptions to this file.
</p>

<p>
	The Battleye filters have been updated for DayZ Epoch 1.0.6.2. Please report any kicks that you get while using the admin tools in this topic. If you are using other mods, then you will have to updates these files or merge them.
</p>

<p>
	You can adjust the humanity and delete times of the ai in EAT_serverAiSpawn.sqf with these two variables: EAT_HumanityGainLoss and EAT_aiDeleteTimer.
</p>

<p>
	Note on the base manager: This line in BEserver.cfg will kick you if you try to make too large of a dome with the copy function. MaxCreateVehiclePerInterval 150 1 You either need to increase the value or avoid making large domes with the copy function.
</p>

<p>
	There are far too many updates and fixes to list here. It would be a mile long. A fairly complete list is in my change log on github.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	If you notice any problems post them here.

<p>
	I made some modifications to the A2Logistics tow/lift script a while ago and finally got around to making an official fork for anyone to use. It makes a better attempt at considering weights of vehicles to add a more realistic spin on towing and lifting. It should be fairly straightforward if you wish to modify anything.<br />
	Here's some of the changes it brings:
</p>

<ul><li>
		Adds tiers of vehicles by estimated weight such as Large, Medium, Small, and Tiny for Ground and Air vehicles.
	</li>
	<li>
		A vehicle can tow anything of it's own size or smaller. So a Large ground vehicle can tow any ground vehicle. A medium vehicle like an SUV can only tow other medium vehicles and smaller.
	</li>
	<li>
		A tank can tow any ground vehicle BUT can not be lifted
	</li>
	<li>
		A Large helicopter can lift small and tiny helicopters.
	</li>
	<li>
		A Large helicopter can lift any ground vehicle, whereas a medium helicopter can only lift medium and smaller.
	</li>
	<li>
		The airTug car (classname "TowingTractor" and other tractors) can tow any plane.
	</li>
	<li>
		Most boats are considered 'medium' cars
	</li>
	<li>
		Adds option to drop lifted vehicles when flying above 50 alt
	</li>
	<li>
		If you drop a vehicle above 50 alt, it will get a parachute and smoke grenade attached. "ParachuteBigWest" if large vehicle, otherwise "ParachuteMediumWest"
	</li>
	<li>
		Automatically translates for english, german, and french players on a<span> </span><strong>per player</strong><span> </span>basis. Previously the server developer had to choose one for all players
	</li>
</ul><p>
	You can find the download and install instructions <a href="https://github.com/ZzBombardierzZ/A2Epoch_Logistic" rel="external nofollow">HERE</a><br /><br />
	Enjoy!
