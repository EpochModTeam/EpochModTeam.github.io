    [Semi - Completed] Crash Loot Script - Arma 3
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/10227-semi-completed-crash-loot-script-arma-3/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>Hello Epoch Community,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's me again with another idea worked out, ishh...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have always had this idea in my head for a while, just a little promo before I explain</p>
<p> </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSWkntxddhE&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, a while back while playing dayz, I had a vehicle with items in that got destroyed. Not that anything really important was destroyed, but the idea of having the loot spawn around the destroyed vehicle like the heli crashes crossed my mind. Since then, it was always on my mind until today, when I finally decided to create it, for arma 3, or course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Gist:</p>
<p>When the vehicle is destroyed, it takes the inventory of the vehicle and scatters it on the ground</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>Check if locked - for obvious reasons, we don't want to incline people to destroy every vehicle</p>
<p>Update every 4 seconds - from the server side, the vehicles are updated with their latest information</p>
<p>Happens for every vehicle - every vehicle that is in Arma 3 can have this attached automatically</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This script would just reside on the server side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once again, if any devs want it, let me know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks!  :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>EDIT: I have finished my crash loot script to some extent. I have not added destroyed chance for the item as I don't know how the dev's would want to handle it. I have the basic handle when killed and 10 second refresh on the gear variables. Works like a charm and I have not seen it fail yet. If the dev's would like the scripts, just message me. For some reason if(locked _unit) does not work in arma 3, I have no idea why. So you might have to handle lock in a variable. Just stick the script files in the mission folder and you are all set to go!</p>

   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/46071-persistent-player-zombiebandit-kill-stats-mod-or-how-to/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I began my Arma journey way back in Arma 2 with a very niche mod called Dayz Echo. Among other features, it had a levelling system, which gave you various benefits each level such as new loadouts when spawning in.
</p>

<p>
	Now I've successfully started my own server and I'd like to pull of something similar. At the very least I'd want to keep track of everything I've killed thus far (not playing online so player kills are not important). Is there any existing and available mod that would help me on the right path? I found some, such as <a href="https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/36733-releasedp-quick-and-dirty-stats/?tab=comments#comment-255442" rel="">this script by DirtySanchez</a> but many of the Github and similar links are long gone by now.
</p>

<p>
	If there's nothing, I could also explore how to make one for myself if someone could describe the process to me as in what would need to be done in broad strokes.
</p>

<p>
	Here's an example of what I'd ideally want to achieve from the Dayz Echo mod I used to play.
</p>

<p>

   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Just returned to Epoch after running other mods for some time.
</p>

<p>
	Server running nice and most settings has been set however I wish to increase the chance to encounter antagonists.
</p>

<p>
	Currently after many hours the only thing I have come across is a helicopter  dropping a box, no more and no less. 
</p>

<p>
	Which file and parameter increase the antagonists chance to spawn?
</p>

<p>
	As a side note I don't wish to use zombies or demons on the server. Happy with the original Epoch antagonists.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Thanks.

    EpochZ - Battleye setvariable restriction #0

    <![CDATA[
<p>
	I am enjoying Grahame's EpochZ immensely.  However, if you are infected by the z's, after 30min you will die (animation for the 30min infection period is excellent btw). Upon death you will be shown the option to re-spawn. At that time you are promptly kicked by BattlEye for setvariable restriction #0:
</p>

<p>
	If you are killed by the z's (beaten to death), upon your death you will also be shown a re-spawn option and then promptly kicked again for a BattlEye setvariable restriction #0:

All the other filters in the setvariable.txt all start with  !=  which would indicates the filter must match exactly which would lead me to believe the key word that I need is something entirely different. I am using BattlEye Filter Manager to add the exceptions to the setvariable.txt. As you'll see, all the exceptions have !=" instead of !" unlike the last two that I have placed.

	Ideas? Getting kicked every time you get killed by a Z has to be annoying to theses guys and I'd rather not lose the few that are consistently playing on our server. Any help is greatly appreciated.

</p>

<p>
	                                    {30708,11868.7,0},<br />
	                                    40,<br />
	                                    {"Landvehicle","Ship","Tank","AIR"}, <br />
	                                    "Service Point Land / Ship / Air" ,
</p>

<p>
	                                    {31173.6,10950.4,0},<br />
	                                    40,<br />

    Vehicle Flip
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/45028-vehicle-flip/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hi all, Ive been looking for a while now for a vehicle flip script for a single player.
</p>

<p>
	Ive tried stuff ive used on previous servers but its not allowing the option so im guessing epoch has something that interferes with it.
</p>

<p>
	If anyone knows of a simple script to allow players to do this could you link it to me please,
</p>

<p>
	Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
	PS. Im aware the jacks flip vehicles but I actually  find this to be incredibly painstaking unless theirs a trick to it.

    Ignatz Tools clarification
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/45287-ignatz-tools-clarification/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hello all,
</p>

<p>
	I  heard a lot of good things about Ignatz_Tools and i am trying to install them on to my server. No luck.<br />
	I am 100% sure i'm not placing everything i need to, into the right locations. I am having really bad luck with the instructions. 
</p>

<p>
	My instructions:
</p>

<p>
	   - copy the files from epoch.mission into your mission file (if init.sqf already exist, paste the code into this file)<br />
	   - Add the following lines from CfgActionMenu_self.hpp into this file: "epoch.mission\epoch_config\Configs\CfgActionMenu\CfgActionMenu_self.hpp"<br />
	   - Put your servercomandpassword in @epochhive\addons\ignatz_server\config.cpp<br />
	   - All other Settings are in Epoch.Mission\ignatz_config.hpp
</p>

<p>
	The files i obtained are named as follows;<br />
	Folder- @Epochhive<br />
	Folder- epoch.Mission<br />
	.txt-      Battleye<br />
	HPP-    CfgActionMenu_self<br />
	.EXT-    descriptions.ext
</p>

<p>
	The first thing that struck me is servercommandpassword... I don't have one of these, or it's called something else.
</p>

<p>
	I was going to list all the things i had done to accomplish this correctly, but i'm afraid it is much easier to admit upfront i can't put it together right, as i have no idea where to put some of this.
</p>

<p>
	I'm 100% sure i did the init. correctly.<br />
	I'm 100% sure i added the description ext. correctly.<br />
	I'm 100% sure i modified the CfgActionMenu_self correctly.
</p>

<p>
	One giant hint would be to ask this. Is any of this modified "outside" the epoch.Altis.pbo?<br />
	I'm assuming so since i found this \epoch_config\Configs\CfgActionMenu\CfgActionMenu_self.hpp" in my file manager folder.
</p>

<p>
	My major concern is that from server host to server host the files are set up differently
</p>

<p>
	what happens if this isn't done? ---&gt;- Put your servercomandpassword in @epochhive\addons\ignatz_server\config.cpp
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Hope this is understandable.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks<br /><br />
	 
</p>

    Where is dynamic_vehicle.sqf
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/45285-where-is-dynamic_vehiclesqf/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I am looking to limit the amount of spawns on start/restart. likely MaxVehicleLimit= I had just delete 418 vehicles so i am unclear on that cap. it got to a point you could sit on any mountain top in altis and with binos see at least 3 vehicles.
</p>

<p>
	I was looking through the forums for this and i have found. "look in dynamic_Vehicle.sqf" Except I simply cannot find the file. If it is not in this sqf or this sqf is outdated and no longer exists. where would i find this setting?
</p>

<p>
	I did however open the epoch_server_setting.pbo and edited the config.cpp file limiting the number of specific vehicles, but even if i set everything to 1 i will still get that number every restart until it caps.
</p>

<p>
	thanks for any help pointing me to this

<p>
	Hi Guys as topic: is there a way to add a vanilla map (im using Australia) into the editor with all the map editions from Epoch loaded  - Not just the plain Australia map, ie with the epoch traders and buildings that have been added.
</p>

<p>
	I want to use the traders buildings but add a few other bits that i will then load from the server side ?
</p>

<p>
	thanks

    X groups of Y AI units or X*Y alone AI units?
   </title>
   <link/>
   https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/45160-x-groups-of-y-ai-units-or-xy-alone-ai-units/
   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	I read words from Dwarden saying that in a group of Arma 3 units, each unit have it own brain.
</p>

<p>
	So if instead of creating X groups of Y units i create X*Y alone AI units i will be using more CPU resources?
</p>

<p>
	For Arma 2 this is true (i will be using more CPU resources) since the entire group have only one brain and not one brain per unit. But for Arma 3, i think the use of resources is the same.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone is able to confirm?
</p>

<p>
	Thankyou!

   <description>
    <![CDATA[
<p>
	Searched forum cant find much about Napf- does no one use it ? -
</p>

<p>
	I started a new server with GTX Gaming but cant find how to set up Napf map, Read a bit about loading the Napf files in to the sever as a mod (@Napf folder in the main Server folder) and add @Napf to the start bat. Tried but would not work had loads of errors ie
</p>

<p>
	 Warning Message: No entry 'bin\config.bin/CfgWorlds.Napf'.<br>
	15:10:20 Warning Message: No entry '.gridNumbersOverLines'.<br>
	15:10:20 Warning Message: '/' is not a value<br>
	15:10:20 Warning Message: No entry '.centerPosition'.<br>
	15:10:20 Warning Message: []: '/' not an array<br>
	15:10:20 Cannot evaluate '' - no file<br>
	15:10:20 Warning Message: []: '/' not an array<br>
	15:10:20 Cannot evaluate '' - no file
</p>

<p>
	then i tried a few different versions of Napf
</p>

<p>
	Stuck with this one at the moment <span><span>:</span></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span><span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1425442364&amp;searchtext=napf" rel="external nofollow">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1425442364</a></span></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>when trying to join server i was also getting errors 1 from A3 Laucher showing server as Epoch experimental so it wont load as its not on steam and other from within Arma 3 (see pics  )</span><a class="ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image" data-fileid="2413" href="https://epochmod.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2018_07/2.png.36e9c22b38bed73bb458a577309a95a3.png" rel=""><img alt="2.thumb.png.8998b0f3e0b8f8b811f74f0144ee170b.png" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="2413" src="https://epochmod.com/forum/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" data-src="https://epochmod.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2018_07/2.thumb.png.8998b0f3e0b8f8b811f74f0144ee170b.png" width="1000" data-ratio="50.8"></a><a class="ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image" data-fileid="2412" href="https://epochmod.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2018_07/24405844_1.png.b6cb9f18710124ed10061413c4ccbe33.png" rel=""><img alt="738087_1.thumb.png.c3b0227c997889f4a24f363cdcf7cf47.png" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="2412" src="https://epochmod.com/forum/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" data-src="https://epochmod.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2018_07/738087_1.thumb.png.c3b0227c997889f4a24f363cdcf7cf47.png" width="1000" data-ratio="56.3"></a>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	So my real question is does some have a how too instructions of loading Napf on to a A3 Epoch server.
</p>

<p>
	or can give me some more insite on how to do it
</p>

<p>
	Thanks in advance
