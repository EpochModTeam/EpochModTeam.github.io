<p>Hey people :)</p>
<p>Merry x-mas to you all.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>For more than a month now, I've been battling a major problem regarding a new NAPF gameplay combo I have planned.</p>
<p>I must say that I am a huge fan of realism and are planning my game scenario accordingly..</p>
<p>Oh, and I gotta remember to tell you, I'm also setting up my own server. Mainly to see if I can do it, but also as a LAN server, and a playground for a few friends online.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>This is a PVE server, since I don't like PVP.</p>
<p>The main concept is that it has been an virus outbreak, something like the great plague, that has killed off 90% of the worlds polulation. In some very few instances this virus has mutated and created zombies, but they are vey few and far between.</p>
<p>NAPF was, before the appocalypse, occupied by soviet forces. The west was helping the resistance on the island with supplies and military advisors, and because of that there are a little of US made equipment still to be found. But very little, and no heavy weapons.</p>
<p>Now, 12-15 years after the plague, the Island of Suhrenfeld contains most of the remaining RUS forces, are controlled by a rogue RUS genral. There's a large RUS millitary base on the Island, with a couple of small outposts. This base contains all of the remaining heavy and hight tech weapon systems on NAPF. As well as armoured vehicles, no tanks though, and the very few remaining operational helis.</p>
<p>The whole of Suhrenfeld are like a fortress.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>On the main Island three bandit camps are located. One big, two smaller. All working together. Theese have most of the millitary weapons that are on the main island. But no heavy weapons. The heaviest being .50 cal machineguns of russian origin. No armoured vehicles are longer in operational order on the main Island.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>In the biggest cities there are civillian survivors trying to stay alive. Having fortified a square of buildings or large houses.</p>
<p>Theese are mainly armed with handguns, hunting rifles and shotguns. And various meele weapons.</p>
<p>Patrols are kriss crossing the Island, both a few from the rouge RUS army, and bandits. Most of the later, in vehicles and on foot. You can encounter them anywhere.</p>
<p>As well as a few civillian scavenger patrols.</p>
<p>Loot are very scarse. Millitay weapon loot non existing, and other weapons hard to find. Meele weapons mostly.</p>
<p>debris and burned out cars al littering the landscape and blocking roads.</p>
<p>Operational helis are not to be found at all. And anyway, how many civillians would know how to opeate a heli. Much less repair it..</p>
<p>That's the big picture..</p>
<p>Now, over to the problems I've been battling for the last month.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>It's regarding static units in the RUS millitary camp on Suhrenfeld.</p>
<p>I simply cant make them work..</p>
<p>And static in my book, means stationary guards. In sandbag nests, on roof tops, in front of the hotel entrances. Your average guard.</p>
<p>Most manning .50 cal MG's, facing their field of fire.</p>
<p>And here is the problem.</p>
<p>I am using the ARMA2 3d editor building the base. Setting up anything from structures, buildings to the static guards and the guardposts.</p>
<p>And there's a LOT of theese guards.</p>
<p>Two, at every entrance to the base, four in front of the main entrance to the high security area ( the fenced off area containing he hotels).</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Three manning heavy MG's on each roof top, plus a spotter carrying AT weapons in each sandbag nest up there. Plus two snipers on the small roof on the middle of the hotell roof. Behind a wall of sand bags. Then there are four extra light towers, each with a AA unit.</p>
<p>As you probably can tell, there is a LOT of them. Close to 30 in this base alone. Not mentioning the patrols inside the camp, some outside and also some armoured patrols roaming the Island. Bu theese moving units, I don't think will be a problem.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>What I am fighting are simply the simple task of having the static units facing their respective directions.</p>
<p>There seems to be a certain limit to the munber of units that can be given instructions in their respective init fields. As far as I have discovered, the limit are somewhere around 25. Or even less some times. depending on how they are grouped together.</p>
<p>I am now using a simple guard script, found in the armaholic homepage. That seems so work a little better than anything else. But I'm still having the problem that units simply ignores what you put in the init field. All facing the default north. Some times even running around like headless chickens, regardless of what command are being used in the init field.</p>
<p>And I have tried ALL commands I have found. With pretty much the same result. All seems fine when running a "prewiev" in the 3d editor, but not working when uploaded to the server.</p>
<p>I have tried to script the units in, putting all in a single script, calling the script in server_monitor.sqf. Or even splitting the units up in several scripts, with max 14 in each script. Trying to have theese scripts run AFTER the custom buildings have been spawned in. This seems to work a little better, but still, when I reach a total of 25 to 28 static guards, they still ignore to face the direction they are commanded. But facing due north.</p>
<p>Must say that I am getting seriously tired of this by now.</p>
<p>I have even tried to set a delay of 20 seconds before AI scripts are executed, but no difference.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Tried to use WAI 2.14, for the static, but they ignore facing all together. Just give error in my RPT. The first line in the static setup, position can be used like this;</p>
<p>Â  [ facing direction [ x-axis, y-axis, azimuth ]] This I read that are a correct way of setting position. But it doesn't work. Just get error. So, I have found that WAI are useless for static guards of theese guards are suposed to be facing anywhere else than default- north.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>So, I was told that I could put the guards on a trigger. That seems to be to be the best idea, saving the server a bit of work, not spawning the guards in until a player are.. Let's say within a 1000 metres.</p>
<p>The thing is, I am not able to find any explanation how to do this anywhere. I don't want to have a zillion scripts being executed, one for each unit, or even one for each group. Since I have a feeling that is going to, again, stop working when the "limit" of 25 to 28 guards are reached.</p>
<p>Is there any way to have the triggers and the units in one script?</p>
<p>I should inform you that I am more or lett ignorant when it comes to scripting :) Never even heard of SQF before I started this :)</p>
<p>I have been able to find a lot about triggers on the net, but it all seems to be written for those of you that can already run, not for us that have to learn to crawl beforewe can run..</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>I read the mission.sqm file in my NAPF folder, and as far as I can see, there are both triggers and units in there. Is that correct? Could be the traders maybe.</p>
<p>If so, it should be possible to have the triggers and the units in the same sqf file. Or maybe even modify the mission.sqm. Or, create a custom one..</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Seriously need help with this, guys. Guards are after all rather useless staring into a concrete wall or standing outside the sandbag fence looking inside it..</p>
<p>I guess triggering theese static guard units in are the last chance of maybe getting around the problem of units ignoring directional commands.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Be grateful for any help :)</p>
<p>And rather step by step, since I have no clue as to what I'm doing :)</p>

    "text": "Hey people :) \nMerry x-mas to you all. \n\u00a0 \nFor more than a month now, I\u0027ve been battling a major problem regarding a new NAPF gameplay combo I have planned. \nI must say that I am a huge fan of realism and are planning my game scenario accordingly.. \nOh, and I gotta remember to tell you, I\u0027m also setting up my own server. Mainly to see if I can do it, but also as a LAN server, and a playground for a few friends online. \n\u00a0 \nThis is a PVE server, since I don\u0027t like PVP. \nThe main concept is that it has been an virus outbreak, something like the great plague, that has killed off 90% of the worlds polulation. In some very few instances this virus has mutated and created zombies, but they are vey few and far between. \nNAPF was, before the appocalypse, occupied by soviet forces. The west was helping the resistance on the island with supplies and military advisors, and because of that there are a little of US made equipment still to be found. But very little, and no heavy weapons. \nNow, 12-15 years after the plague, the Island of Suhrenfeld contains most of the remaining RUS forces, are controlled by a rogue RUS genral. There\u0027s a large RUS millitary base on the Island, with a couple of small outposts. This base contains all of the remaining heavy and hight tech weapon systems on NAPF. As well as armoured vehicles, no tanks though, and the very few remaining operational helis. \nThe whole of Suhrenfeld are like a fortress. \n\u00a0 \nOn the main Island three bandit camps are located. One big, two smaller. All working together. Theese have most of the millitary weapons that are on the main island. But no heavy weapons. The heaviest being .50 cal machineguns of russian origin. No armoured vehicles are longer in operational order on the main Island. \n\u00a0 \nIn the biggest cities there are civillian survivors trying to stay alive. Having fortified a square of buildings or large houses. \nTheese are mainly armed with handguns, hunting rifles and shotguns. And various meele weapons. \nPatrols are kriss crossing the Island, both a few from the rouge RUS army, and bandits. Most of the later, in vehicles and on foot. You can encounter them anywhere. \nAs well as a few civillian scavenger patrols. \nLoot are very scarse. Millitay weapon loot non existing, and other weapons hard to find. Meele weapons mostly. \ndebris and burned out cars al littering the landscape and blocking roads. \nOperational helis are not to be found at all. And anyway, how many civillians would know how to opeate a heli. Much less repair it.. \nThat\u0027s the big picture.. \nNow, over to the problems I\u0027ve been battling for the last month. \n\u00a0 \nIt\u0027s regarding static units in the RUS millitary camp on Suhrenfeld. \nI simply cant make them work.. \nAnd static in my book, means stationary guards. In sandbag nests, on roof tops, in front of the hotel entrances. Your average guard. \nMost manning .50 cal MG\u0027s, facing their field of fire. \nAnd here is the problem. \nI am using the ARMA2 3d editor building the base. Setting up anything from structures, buildings to the static guards and the guardposts. \nAnd there\u0027s a LOT of theese guards. \nTwo, at every entrance to the base, four in front of the main entrance to the high security area ( the fenced off area containing he hotels). \n\u00a0 \nThree manning heavy MG\u0027s on each roof top, plus a spotter carrying AT weapons in each sandbag nest up there. Plus two snipers on the small roof on the middle of the hotell roof. Behind a wall of sand bags. Then there are four extra light towers, each with a AA unit. \nAs you probably can tell, there is a LOT of them. Close to 30 in this base alone. Not mentioning the patrols inside the camp, some outside and also some armoured patrols roaming the Island. Bu theese moving units, I don\u0027t think will be a problem. \n\u00a0 \nWhat I am fighting are simply the simple task of having the static units facing their respective directions. \nThere seems to be a certain limit to the munber of units that can be given instructions in their respective init fields. As far as I have discovered, the limit are somewhere around 25. Or even less some times. depending on how they are grouped together. \nI am now using a simple guard script, found in the armaholic homepage. That seems so work a little better than anything else. But I\u0027m still having the problem that units simply ignores what you put in the init field. All facing the default north. Some times even running around like headless chickens, regardless of what command are being used in the init field. \nAnd I have tried ALL commands I have found. With pretty much the same result. All seems fine when running a \"prewiev\" in the 3d editor, but not working when uploaded to the server. \nI have tried to script the units in, putting all in a single script, calling the script in server_monitor.sqf. Or even splitting the units up in several scripts, with max 14 in each script. Trying to have theese scripts run AFTER the custom buildings have been spawned in. This seems to work a little better, but still, when I reach a total of 25 to 28 static guards, they still ignore to face the direction they are commanded. But facing due north. \nMust say that I am getting seriously tired of this by now. \nI have even tried to set a delay of 20 seconds before AI scripts are executed, but no difference. \n\u00a0 \nTried to use WAI 2.14, for the static, but they ignore facing all together. Just give error in my RPT. The first line in the static setup, position can be used like this; \n\u00a0 [ facing direction [ x-axis, y-axis, azimuth ]] This I read that are a correct way of setting position. But it doesn\u0027t work. Just get error. So, I have found that WAI are useless for static guards of theese guards are suposed to be facing anywhere else than default- north. \n\u00a0 \nSo, I was told that I could put the guards on a trigger. That seems to be to be the best idea, saving the server a bit of work, not spawning the guards in until a player are.. Let\u0027s say within a 1000 metres. \nThe thing is, I am not able to find any explanation how to do this anywhere. I don\u0027t want to have a zillion scripts being executed, one for each unit, or even one for each group. Since I have a feeling that is going to, again, stop working when the \"limit\" of 25 to 28 guards are reached. \nIs there any way to have the triggers and the units in one script? \nI should inform you that I am more or lett ignorant when it comes to scripting :) Never even heard of SQF before I started this :) \nI have been able to find a lot about triggers on the net, but it all seems to be written for those of you that can already run, not for us that have to learn to crawl beforewe can run.. \n\u00a0 \nI read the mission.sqm file in my NAPF folder, and as far as I can see, there are both triggers and units in there. Is that correct? Could be the traders maybe. \nIf so, it should be possible to have the triggers and the units in the same sqf file. Or maybe even modify the mission.sqm. Or, create a custom one.. \n\u00a0 \nSeriously need help with this, guys. Guards are after all rather useless staring into a concrete wall or standing outside the sandbag fence looking inside it.. \nI guess triggering theese static guard units in are the last chance of maybe getting around the problem of units ignoring directional commands. \n\u00a0 \nBe grateful for any help :) \nAnd rather step by step, since I have no clue as to what I\u0027m doing :) \n",
